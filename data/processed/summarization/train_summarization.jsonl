I was ashamed, and vowed I would only tell my ex if he told me he wanted to get back together. Well before that happened, a mutual friend of ours told him, and he rightfully freaked out. He basically told me it killed him, but he was willing to try. After about a month, we got back together for three months. Everything was absolutely perfect, except when he drank, he would always bring up my mistake. About a week ago, he dumps me. He came over last night and told me it was due to the fact that he couldn't forgive me for sleeping with the other guy, and it wasn't fair for him to keep yelling at me over it. I know I'm young, but I see myself with this man forever. He is truly everything I want in a man, and I cannot just sit by and let him walk away.

I didn't find out they were engaged until I looked at her Facebook page and where she still has dozens of photos of them together and all her friends congratulating her on the engagement. I found this odd because she had talked about him alot but intentionally hid the fact that they were engaged, only ever referring to him as her \"ex boyfriend\". I asked her why she never told me and her response was that \"she didn't want to scare me away\". Her ex bought a dog with her, so they take turns sharing the dog for a week. So they are still in touch with each other and she still talks to his parents about logistical things as well. \n\nI have no problem with her talking to her ex fiance about logistics, because we aren't in an exclusive relationship. However, this girl keeps telling me how much she likes me, but when I asked her what she thought \"about us\" she sounded confused and responded \"well... I like hanging out with you\" which was strange considering how much she professes her feelings for me. I like this girl alot.

Mind, he's the one to suggest a place and time maybe 1\/3 - half of the time, but he seems to do it in a hastily manner and often he will cancel because he forgot he actually already made plans at the time he suggested. I know this is a red flag and I'm very aware that if he doesn't step up his game, he's just not that into me. But I want to give him a chance, as I know he's brand new to relationships and probably just isn't used to having to spend so much time on a different person + a lack of planning skills.

That went fine.\n\nLater on we opened the door and let them see each other. There was immediate hissing\/growling from the girl cat. I understand this is probably normal. I was giving the girl cat a lot of affection in front of the new cat, so it didn't feel threatened.

In her mind, if two or three couples that she knows are married and (apparently) well, then our marriage is gonna work.\n\nWe went through a list of expenses we would have together, and reached a conclusion that our incomes summed up wouldn't be enough.

{"prompt":"All info has been altered as she's a redditor.\n\nThe two of us met online (she's really a girl and everything she claims to be), on reddit actually, a couple months ago. We quickly became friends and, after speaking to each other a ton, realized that we were extremely alike. A couple weeks ago we started to really talk non stop as in we would be speaking with each other all day. We eventually confessed that we like each other and set up a few remote dates as she lives in Georiga while I'm in New York. I understand there was no obligation for either of us to do anything.\n\nWe shared all kinds of personal information that two regular people wouldn't share online and I was fairly happy with the direction things were going in. While we discussed all sorts of things, the key piece, I believe, is when we discussed our other long term relationships. She had just been in a four year relationship with a guy that had been broken off just three months ago.\n\nWe spoke about how we should take things slowly from now on and I wanted to give her all the time she needed. Then, however, and rather abruptly, we stopped talking all day and instead, and, not for a lack of effort on my part, were barely speaking to each other. This all culminated today when I finally asked her what was up and she said that we should just be friends. She also suggested that we keep doing some of the things we were doing.\n\nNaturally I was a bit heartbroken, but I'd seen the writing on the wall. I was hoping it wasn't the case and I was simply being dumb, but it seems I was right.

This past January, \"S\" and her longterm bf broke up. \n\nA couple weeks ago, \"S\" and I went as each other's dates to a mutual friends wedding, and ended up getting drunk and hooking up all weekend. \n\nIt's happened a couple more times since then when we were sober so I know it wasn't some drunken mistake.\n\nShe's told me a few times that she's not ready for a relationship and wants to enjoy being single for a while and get to date around for the first time in years. \n\nMy problem is that I genuinely have feelings for this girl and even though she says she doesn't want a relationship, every time we're together she acts like my gf (rubbing my leg under the table, cuddling, etc), yet she actively keeps reiterating that this needs to stop because it could get messy and then 2hrs later is all over me..\n\nI'm just frustrated because I don't know whether or not to keep the whole thing going in the chance that she decides she wants to date or if I should quit the physical part and just go back to being friends so I don't get fucked over.....","chosen":"hooked up with my best friend and caught the feelings despite her saying she doesn't want a relationship. everytime we're together she acts like my gf despite keeping telling me otherwise.. need advice on what to do next.","rejected":"hooked up w\/best friend, caught the feels, she wants it to stop bc could get messy, but is adamant otherwise, not sure what to do... help?"}
{"prompt":"So, a little bit about us. Her and I are both 20. We have been together for 2.5 years, and started getting really serious the last couple months. We met over facebook and texted every day all day the last two years. The last couple months, we actually started visiting and spending more time together. The scenario is as follows.\n\nDerpette wants to attend a college near my hometown for her masters later this year which I think is AMAZING! However, we have not really got to spend much face time together. (We have spent about 5 days together a couple of times) We are talking about getting a place together when she moves here which we are both really excited about. However, this summer, she wants to attend a school sponsored overseas trip for 3 months. She thinks it is a great opportunity, (which I agree) but, I think it would be a smarter idea, to get a place together for those three months to see how it would go. Me being me, I see myself as being the type of father on the movie \"Taken\", so of course, I have my worries about her safety and just overall well being. Most likely she will be going with people she has never met. She doesn't even really talk to anybody but her cousin and I. Another part of my argument is, it won't be the only opportunity for her to do something like this. I work with a company that does a lot of work overseas, which she likes the idea of tagging along. \n\nAm I in the wrong for not supporting this trip? Or should I back off for making her \"frustrated\" about the whole thing? I am not a father-like boyfriend at all, but I just do not like the idea.","chosen":"GF wants to go to school trip for 3 months overseas, but I think we should get a place together as well.

{"prompt":"We met back in October, and became friends rather quickly. We both recently got out of a couple of long-term relationships (about 2 years each, both got out around 5-6 months ago). I've heard him bring up his ex a few times, and I've talked about mine with our friend group on a few occasions as well. Since we started out as friends, talking about these things didn't seem so taboo.\n\nI knew immediately that I was somewhat attracted to him, but since I was still pretty hung up on my ex, I didn't want to pursue it at all. I recall him telling me the same thing back when we were first becoming friends.\n\nThen about a month ago, we hooked up. No sex, but heavy making out\/cuddling. We were drinking, but neither of us were anywhere near drunk. For a few weeks following this, we had some weird kind of cuddle-buddy thing going on. I know we probably should've, but we never talked about any of this.\n\nNow he's really all I can think about. I'm starting to develop real feelings for him. I've also noticed that I'm not thinking about my ex that much anymore nowadays. I haven;t stopped thinking of him completely, but it's drastically less than the beginning of the semester.\n\nThe problem is that over break, I've been feel ourselves drifting apart. I don't know if I'm just too attached to my phone or he prefers talking in person more or whatever (our primary form of communications since break started is text), but we talk less and less everyday. I'm afraid that I'm getting on his nerves.\n\nWe get back from break in a few weeks, so I can see if there's any drastic change in the way he interacts with me when we get back.\n\nMy question is: Is this something I should pursue? I think I would be up to make the first move if I can confirm that there is even some kind of hope that he'd say yes. However, we have such a good friendship, and I'm afraid of losing that.\n\nAlso, should I take the talking less over break thing personally? Or am I just over-thinking things?","chosen":"I have developed feelings for my friend who I've been hooking up with.

We originally discussed trying to be in the same geographical region in the country for our next set of jobs, but unfortunately it's still up in the air where I'll be due to the nature of my job. He is now accusing me of betraying him because he thinks I'm breaking a contract with him, even though I would have never been able to know if advance where my work would send me. We have never truly had a long distance relationship for greater than 3 months.\n\nThe next year is definitely going to be very busy for me at work, and I don't know if I can devote nearly as much time to the relationship. He is very strict that we need to equally visit each other, and that I have to spend all my free weekends with him, or else it won't work. In addition, I'm still not sure after 6yrs if he's the one. We're really great friends, and love to hang out together to do different activities. However, we have poor communication when we're apart, making long distance predictably challenging. For example, if I go away for a month, he will call\/email 3-4x during that whole time. The lack of communication is very unsatisfying. We both have put a lot into the relationship, and the fact that I'm already in my mid-20s is making this harder!","chosen":"I'm wondering if I should stay with him and try to work it out, or just cut my losses and move on?","rejected":"I'm having second thoughts about staying with a man who wants to break up and I'm not sure if I can go through with it."}
{"prompt":"Some context - my girlfriend\/Mistress and I are in a 24\/7 D\/s relationship, but because this is a private matter between us we have not shared it with my friends (except out mutual friends who are similarly into D\/s). I know our relationship isn't abusive. We have strict safewords, limitations on when D\/s is probably not appropriate, and she cares deeply about my welfare and safety.\n\nProblem is, my friends don't see that. What *they* see is a woman bossing me around in public and me meekly obeying, sometimes preventing me from going to social events without giving reasons why, and when they're over at our house they see her telling me what to do and me obeying. I wear a \"day-collar\", which is a discreet locking necklace that most BDSM practitioners would recognise, but my friends aren't really into kink so they don't know what it is. I'd like to avoid mentioning our relationship structure if possible, because it's a very private thing that I took a long time to admit to myself that I desire from a relationship, and which has caused me a not-small amount of mental distress when I finally tried to accept it. \n\nSo, either I'd like ways to convince them I'm NOT being abused, or ways to convince them that my Mistress isn't my abuser. I've been in abusive relationships before, and I think that's why my friends are worried. The difference is that, in those relationships, I had no power and no balances. I got no say in the relationship, and it took me a lot of effort to get out. In this relationship, I know I have the right to say no, and that it will be respected, and I know that she loves me deeply and cares about my suggestions, thoughts and feelings. I choose to submit and she chooses to dominate, but we both know that if I really need to, I can stop and we will work it out as equals.","chosen":"My girlfriend and I are in a 24\/7 D\/s relationship, but my friends think it's abusive.

{"prompt":"I've been using MFP with moderate success, and I've been frustrated because I've had success in the past on WW and liked counting points.

I always ate all of my weekly points as well as the points I earned with exercise, and I lost about 2 lbs\/week and about 50 lbs total.

{"prompt":"I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub-reddit for this question\/plea for help. If anyone could suggest where it would better belong I can x-post there! Thanks!\n\nMy cat is about 1.5 years old (rescue) and has been deemed other wise in good health by our vet. She has all of her shots, eats well(usually just over 1 dish of food a day, recently nearing 2), has been gaining some \"winter weight\" recently, but has become very clingy\/needy recently.

When she eats these things she almost immediately vomits, I have cleaned up 6~8 piles today alone. \nHer food has not changed recently, she has access to her food all day and fresh water throughout the day as well. She has always had a thing for chewing on plastic, but in the past few weeks it's become worse. This combined with the fact she will not leave me alone means I'm at my wits end. We (the cat and I) have never really gotten a long well but my BF has been traveling slightly more than normal and she has defaulted on me. I have found if I put a few small dabs of vic's vapor rub on my PC chair or sofa she will leave them alone for most of the day, but now the whole house smells...\n\nCould this all just be stress related due to her person of choice traveling? Is there anything that I can do to stop this behavior? Should I change her food (she has been on it for over 6 months and done well)?","chosen":"cat eats non-editable items regularly (plastic toys, paper, etc), will not leave me alone, destroying\/vomiting things, very clingy\/needy for some reason, has not changed food in about two months, has not changed her diet for the past 6 months.","rejected":"My cat is destroying plastic and paper items to eat.

We live over two hours apart which isn't horrible distance but still sucks.  She's taking a year off before applying to grad schools, but I started working full time so visiting is restricted. And even then, we both have our own friends and family so visiting would be limited to maybe once a month. \n\nMy problem is with her parents (more her dad) who is pretty controlling\/conservative as many Filipino\/Asian parents are. My parents are fine with me spending a weekend there, but her dad only allows her to visit for a day and doesn't allow her staying with my family for the weekend.

EVERYTHING about other girls and such(which I try to tell her she if different from, which she is.).  This relationship is also long distance.\n\nSo things are great, but every few weeks she will just get upset from nowhere and worry that she can't trust me or that I talk to other girls.  This really hurts me because it just makes me feel like i'm doing something wrong, but also that maybe she has something to hide (albeit I know all of her secrets).\n\nFor example yesterday we were talking and she just got upset and we didn't really have time to have a complete discussion because she was going to a public viewing for the world cup.  Germany won and I was excited for us and wrote her a bit during the game and after, however she didn't reply until 9am this morning to tell me that \"ah it was a crazy night.\" \"I drink a bit much.\" (we just wrote and she said she was out until 3\/4am and didn't write because there were people everywhere)\n\nAs a side note she is always telling me about guys trying to flirt with her, or that she has to be careful what she wears so that she doesn't make guys crazy.  I try to just play it off like I don't care, but it makes me really jealous and protective which I don't want to be.\n\nMaybe I'm just being a bit ridiculous about this and need to calm down, but I feel a bit hurt that she wouldn't want to write me to share the excitement of the win (which I would definitely have done).  I mean it just makes me question everything and I hate it.  But I really love her and feeling like shit right now really sucks.\n\nI guess to summarize if the same situation was reversed she would be absolutely losing her mind that I would have done something that I couldn't undo.","chosen":"My GF has trust issues, and I feel a bit ignored and now am starting to question everything.

The feeling grew deeper and I started thinking about her more often. \n\nRecently I sorta went looking for more pictures of her and found some I'd never seen. When I found them it was like a punch in the gut. I don't know how to explain it. I was sweating and dizzy. I am literally having physical reactions seeing more pictures of his girl. \n\nNow I can't stop thinking about her. What's she's doing? I hope she's okay. I know this is really unhealthy.

My reaction along with certain \"hints\" as I'd been, **extremely** subtly, relaying the message that playing that song at weddings is overdone made her realize what those videos were for and made her tear up a little. I told her I wouldn't do it anymore because the surprise was ruined. I figured I'd do it anyway because she wasn't aware of the rest of the wedding party joining in, but now I'm wondering if it'll be a nice surprise\/\"better\" to write her a song and perform it with the same idea of having the wedding party join in. \n\nIs this too cheesy?

{"prompt":"Advice is a form of nostalgia (so they say!)  \n\nEarlier last week I was taking some casual photos (relevant) at an event with some friends, and I met this girl (24ish) through a mutual friend that was there. Towards the end of the evening, we had a nice conversation that continued all the way up to walking to her car. Just some basic, what-do-you-do\/where-are-you-from stuff, but damn, she intrigued the hell out of me. \n\nI was seriously on the very edge of asking her if she wanted to grab coffee sometime, but alas, I chickened out and we said bye without exchanging numbers or anything. I really, really hate myself for that now. \n\nSo I'm driving home, beating myself up the entire way and trying to figure out how I could see her again. I uploaded photos from the event to facebook and added the girl as a friend so that I could tag her in a couple of them.\n\nI decided to message her, saying I really enjoyed talking to her and would love to continue the conversation, and asked if she wanted to get coffee with me sometime. This still makes me cringe because I feel a facebook message is so impersonal, but it was my fault for not asking for her number earlier and I really didn't know if I'd see her again otherwise. \n\nAnyways, facebook messaging does that lovely thing where it tells you if the recipient has read your message. Which she did. And I've gotten absolutely no response since then. \n\nWelp, I chalk it up to disinterest and I leave it be - not gonna make me lose too much sleep over it. Still, I could've taken a hint if she said something like, \"Sorry, I'm really busy these days,\" as opposed to saying nothing at all. \n\nSo now I know as nerve-wracking as asking someone out in person can be, at least I'll get a relatively immediate response instead of this open-ended, waiting for god-knows-how-long bullshit :)","chosen":"Note to future self: just grow a pair and ask her out while she's still in front of you.

My parents are loving people, and my brother has never been nothing but kind and supportive to me, but it always felt like I was in his shadow.\n\nMy parents are lovely people, but sometimes I feel like they celebrate my brother in ways that draw a comparison to me. Like when I made a joke about not being able to afford something, and my father quickly replied that my brother made six figures last year.

I haven't really been that successful.\n\nAnyway, how do I deal with these feelings of shame and self-hate? And how can I stop comparing myself to my brother in such a self destructive way?

{"prompt":"Well, I don't even know exactly what I expected.  I mean, I had heard that college is supposed to be the optimal time to meet and talk to girls, but it's just not happening for me.  I'm almost half-way through my 2nd year of college, and to say that my love life is barren would be a gross understatement.  I go probably 3-5 days a week without even talking to a girl.  Most of my time is spent doing school work, birding, and hanging out in my dorm.  I just can't grasp how other guys find girls with such ease.  It's not that I'm feeling unhappy; I just have the feeling that there's \"something\" missing.  \n\nPersonality-wise, I'm introverted, somewhat self-centered, and I feel that the way I think about my relationships with others is becoming more analytical than romantic.  So, I think it's fair to say that the number of \"suitable\" girls for me is lower than for most people.  Therefore, because of my personality, it seems I would have to meet a higher number of girls in order to meet someone I would be interested in, but, ALSO because of my personality, I naturally talk to FEWER girls than most others do.  Perhaps this means I'm simply \"destined\" for a life of minimal romantic experiences. \n\nI am already part of a club for people who enjoy nature (one of my greatest passions).  There are several girls in it, but half of them have boyfriends, and I only get to talk to any of them once a week at most anyways.
