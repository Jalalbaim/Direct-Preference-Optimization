I have an ongoing medical issue I am trying to work out with my doctors and specialists, and I let my GF know if I've made an appointment regarding something that has happened recently because I think she at least deserves to know im going to the doctor because (insert reason) happened. Most of the times I tell her this, she tells me what she thinks is wrong with me and sometimes will suggest that I do 'X' whether that is take some over the counter drug, insist that my doctor ruin some test or even to the point one time where she will try to get me to take a prescription drug prescribed to her mom for the issue that she thinks I also have. I am not OK with doing things outside what my doctor recommended. Because of that I will usually get defensive as i am not asking for help, just letting her know I am going to the doctor and we argue about it.

How can I communicate about this without being confrontational, or am I in the wrong for getting defensive ( totally fine with that if it's the case ).

{"prompt":"My original post is [here](\n\nA few days after posting this, I received a call at work from a neighbor, my fiance was trying to fill a forged prescription at Jewel.

Its no where near as fun as some of the things in my past, and its actually a bit of hard work, but I'm hoping it'll pay off. \n\nWe've started up watching shows and movies together.

{"prompt":"It has just dawned on me, why not phase out metal\/alloy\/etc bullets and replace them with rubber \/ other non-lethal projectiles. They're non-lethal, but still pretty damn hurtful and useful for subduing dangerous persons.\n\nTo me, it seems like the perfect solution, so why do I never hear it raised when people are arguing over gun control? I don't claim to be the smartest or most abstract thinker in the world, surely I can't be alone in coming to this idea, so what is wrong with it?\n\nI thought at first that maybe the notion of rubber bullets isn't usually raised due to the injuries that they can cause, but then I realised death is usually a fatal injury. Also, I don't imagine tasers would necessarily be orgasmic for the victim, albeit less fatal than metal bullets.\n\nSo, why are we not discussing this? Why are rubber bullets not a good idea?","chosen":"Why are we not discussing the idea of rubber bullets?","rejected":"Why is no one raising the issue of rubber bullets?"}
{"prompt":"I originally was expecting to move into my new apartment in August, but due to some instability at the time, I was forced to stay with a friend and wait until this month to move in. Today, I received a message from them asking if I was still moving in, and responded that I was since I was receiving my bi-weekly paycheck that would give me enough to pay this month's rent of about $350 (along with a few necessities).\nThey then proceeded to tell me that if I did move in, I would also have to pay the whole first month's rent on top of that, even though I wasn't even living there. I would understand a holding fee, but paying $350 just to hold a spot is utterly ridiculous. I've done the math, and by the time I do get the full $700 or so, it would be time for next month's rent, which would add another $350 on top of that. That means I would essentially have to earn over $1000 in less than a month, literally impossible for someone on my salary.\nAnd here's the icing on the cake; if I decide NOT to move in, they still want to charge me full rent for August AND September. Regardless of what I do, I'll still be down at least $700.\n\nI could really use some help\/advice, guys. I'm at a loss at this point. I do NOT want to take out any loans.","chosen":"I'm being charged $350 for a place I haven't even moved into yet.
