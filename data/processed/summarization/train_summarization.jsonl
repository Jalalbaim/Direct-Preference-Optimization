I have an ongoing medical issue I am trying to work out with my doctors and specialists, and I let my GF know if I've made an appointment regarding something that has happened recently because I think she at least deserves to know im going to the doctor because (insert reason) happened. Most of the times I tell her this, she tells me what she thinks is wrong with me and sometimes will suggest that I do 'X' whether that is take some over the counter drug, insist that my doctor ruin some test or even to the point one time where she will try to get me to take a prescription drug prescribed to her mom for the issue that she thinks I also have. I am not OK with doing things outside what my doctor recommended. Because of that I will usually get defensive as i am not asking for help, just letting her know I am going to the doctor and we argue about it.

How can I communicate about this without being confrontational, or am I in the wrong for getting defensive ( totally fine with that if it's the case ).

{"prompt":"My original post is [here](\n\nA few days after posting this, I received a call at work from a neighbor, my fiance was trying to fill a forged prescription at Jewel.

Its no where near as fun as some of the things in my past, and its actually a bit of hard work, but I'm hoping it'll pay off. \n\nWe've started up watching shows and movies together.

{"prompt":"It has just dawned on me, why not phase out metal\/alloy\/etc bullets and replace them with rubber \/ other non-lethal projectiles. They're non-lethal, but still pretty damn hurtful and useful for subduing dangerous persons.\n\nTo me, it seems like the perfect solution, so why do I never hear it raised when people are arguing over gun control? I don't claim to be the smartest or most abstract thinker in the world, surely I can't be alone in coming to this idea, so what is wrong with it?\n\nI thought at first that maybe the notion of rubber bullets isn't usually raised due to the injuries that they can cause, but then I realised death is usually a fatal injury. Also, I don't imagine tasers would necessarily be orgasmic for the victim, albeit less fatal than metal bullets.\n\nSo, why are we not discussing this? Why are rubber bullets not a good idea?","chosen":"Why are we not discussing the idea of rubber bullets?","rejected":"Why is no one raising the issue of rubber bullets?"}
{"prompt":"I originally was expecting to move into my new apartment in August, but due to some instability at the time, I was forced to stay with a friend and wait until this month to move in. Today, I received a message from them asking if I was still moving in, and responded that I was since I was receiving my bi-weekly paycheck that would give me enough to pay this month's rent of about $350 (along with a few necessities).\nThey then proceeded to tell me that if I did move in, I would also have to pay the whole first month's rent on top of that, even though I wasn't even living there. I would understand a holding fee, but paying $350 just to hold a spot is utterly ridiculous. I've done the math, and by the time I do get the full $700 or so, it would be time for next month's rent, which would add another $350 on top of that. That means I would essentially have to earn over $1000 in less than a month, literally impossible for someone on my salary.\nAnd here's the icing on the cake; if I decide NOT to move in, they still want to charge me full rent for August AND September. Regardless of what I do, I'll still be down at least $700.\n\nI could really use some help\/advice, guys. I'm at a loss at this point.

{"prompt":"So Reddit, I'm getting kind of desperate. I love my father very much, and I'm starting to get horribly worried about him. \n\nHe works twelve hour days on average, being the manager at an office supplies store. There have been times when he worked forty hours in *three days*. He hardly eats at work, since he's so completely busy and understaffed. (His company won't let him hire more employees) He's lost around twenty-thirty pounds since he only ever eats dinner. In general, his company and his employee's are screwing him over. Whenever one of his employee's skips out on my father, my dad has to step in. And he can't do anything about it. We can't afford for him to quit his job of ten years right now either.\n\nThe worst part is that he's seemed to turn to alcohol and cigarettes to help cope. On average he drinks six-eight beers a night, and I have no idea how many cigarettes he smokes on average since he does it in secret even though he knows I know. He refuses to go to the doctor either, so I have no idea how much this affects him. This has been going on for about 2-4 years now.\n\nI've tried confronting him about his problem two or three times, and sometimes he promises he'll stop, and other times he's simply annoyed at me. I'm terrified it's affecting his health- I would never be able to forgive myself if something happened to him because I was too scared to speak up. I'll be honest here, I have a history of depression. As I am right now, I don't think I would be able to live without my father.","chosen":"My father's work is completely screwing him over, and he's turned to alcohol and cigarettes as a result. I just... want advice. Anything would be appreciated.","rejected":"I need advice on how best to handle my father's alcoholism and how to help my father cope with his loss of weight."}

{"prompt":"Been seeing a girl for 6 months. Get along real well with her and have no complaints so far. We were sitting down one day, and the conversation about \"What would you name your kids?\" came up. I offered mine, and she gave her opinions on them, what she liked, what she didn't. That's cool. So I asked about hers. I said I wasn't much of a fan regarding one of the names she mentioned, and she came back with a \"Well, I'd be the one carrying the baby, so it's not like you would have a choice.\"\n\nWhen I dug deeper, she cited that because it's the woman who has to go through the pregnancy and everything that comes with it, so it's only fair that she gets final say in naming her future child. I would never argue what a woman has to go through vs what a man has too. But it's not like the man just sits there and eats popcorn while everything is going on! Plus, it's also raising the child that's important too ya know? \n\nAnyways, I never thought I'd come across a situation like this. I sort of get it, but at the same time it leaves a bad taste in my mouth that she can just freely disregard the names I would ever suggest, and take very little input from me regarding what she wants.

{"prompt":"Hi, I apologize if this is in the wrong subreddit.\n\nI'm a college student who lives in a house with 5 other guys. It's time to either re-sign the lease for a year, or move out.
