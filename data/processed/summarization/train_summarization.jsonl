I have an ongoing medical issue I am trying to work out with my doctors and specialists, and I let my GF know if I've made an appointment regarding something that has happened recently because I think she at least deserves to know im going to the doctor because (insert reason) happened. Most of the times I tell her this, she tells me what she thinks is wrong with me and sometimes will suggest that I do 'X' whether that is take some over the counter drug, insist that my doctor ruin some test or even to the point one time where she will try to get me to take a prescription drug prescribed to her mom for the issue that she thinks I also have.

Because of that I will usually get defensive as i am not asking for help, just letting her know I am going to the doctor and we argue about it.

How can I communicate about this without being confrontational, or am I in the wrong for getting defensive ( totally fine with that if it's the case ).

{"prompt":"My original post is [here](\n\nA few days after posting this, I received a call at work from a neighbor, my fiance was trying to fill a forged prescription at Jewel.

I don't claim to be the smartest or most abstract thinker in the world, surely I can't be alone in coming to this idea, so what is wrong with it?\n\nI thought at first that maybe the notion of rubber bullets isn't usually raised due to the injuries that they can cause, but then I realised death is usually a fatal injury. Also, I don't imagine tasers would necessarily be orgasmic for the victim, albeit less fatal than metal bullets.\n\nSo, why are we not discussing this? Why are rubber bullets not a good idea?","chosen":"Why are we not discussing the idea of rubber bullets?","rejected":"Why is no one raising the issue of rubber bullets?"}
{"prompt":"I originally was expecting to move into my new apartment in August, but due to some instability at the time, I was forced to stay with a friend and wait until this month to move in. Today, I received a message from them asking if I was still moving in, and responded that I was since I was receiving my bi-weekly paycheck that would give me enough to pay this month's rent of about $350 (along with a few necessities).\nThey then proceeded to tell me that if I did move in, I would also have to pay the whole first month's rent on top of that, even though I wasn't even living there. I would understand a holding fee, but paying $350 just to hold a spot is utterly ridiculous. I've done the math, and by the time I do get the full $700 or so, it would be time for next month's rent, which would add another $350 on top of that. That means I would essentially have to earn over $1000 in less than a month, literally impossible for someone on my salary.\nAnd here's the icing on the cake; if I decide NOT to move in, they still want to charge me full rent for August AND September. Regardless of what I do, I'll still be down at least $700.\n\nI could really use some help\/advice, guys. I'm at a loss at this point.

{"prompt":"So Reddit, I'm getting kind of desperate. I love my father very much, and I'm starting to get horribly worried about him. \n\nHe works twelve hour days on average, being the manager at an office supplies store. There have been times when he worked forty hours in *three days*. He hardly eats at work, since he's so completely busy and understaffed. (His company won't let him hire more employees) He's lost around twenty-thirty pounds since he only ever eats dinner. In general, his company and his employee's are screwing him over. Whenever one of his employee's skips out on my father, my dad has to step in. And he can't do anything about it. We can't afford for him to quit his job of ten years right now either.\n\nThe worst part is that he's seemed to turn to alcohol and cigarettes to help cope. On average he drinks six-eight beers a night, and I have no idea how many cigarettes he smokes on average since he does it in secret even though he knows I know. He refuses to go to the doctor either, so I have no idea how much this affects him. This has been going on for about 2-4 years now.\n\nI've tried confronting him about his problem two or three times, and sometimes he promises he'll stop, and other times he's simply annoyed at me. I'm terrified it's affecting his health- I would never be able to forgive myself if something happened to him because I was too scared to speak up. I'll be honest here, I have a history of depression. As I am right now, I don't think I would be able to live without my father.","chosen":"My father's work is completely screwing him over, and he's turned to alcohol and cigarettes as a result. I just... want advice. Anything would be appreciated.","rejected":"I need advice on how best to handle my father's alcoholism and how to help my father cope with his loss of weight."}

{"prompt":"Been seeing a girl for 6 months. Get along real well with her and have no complaints so far. We were sitting down one day, and the conversation about \"What would you name your kids?\" came up. I offered mine, and she gave her opinions on them, what she liked, what she didn't. That's cool. So I asked about hers. I said I wasn't much of a fan regarding one of the names she mentioned, and she came back with a \"Well, I'd be the one carrying the baby, so it's not like you would have a choice.\"\n\nWhen I dug deeper, she cited that because it's the woman who has to go through the pregnancy and everything that comes with it, so it's only fair that she gets final say in naming her future child. I would never argue what a woman has to go through vs what a man has too. But it's not like the man just sits there and eats popcorn while everything is going on! Plus, it's also raising the child that's important too ya know? \n\nAnyways, I never thought I'd come across a situation like this. I sort of get it, but at the same time it leaves a bad taste in my mouth that she can just freely disregard the names I would ever suggest, and take very little input from me regarding what she wants.

{"prompt":"So I met this girl at my school about a year ago. My first impressions of her was wow she's really pretty but i never had the intention of looking for a relationship back then.

{"prompt":"I don't really know how to format this post because it's all just random thoughts so I here goes.\nI don't know if this is the right sub reddit to post this too either, so sorry if it's not.\n\nAnyway, here it is.\nI'm 16, in 10th grade on high school. I haven't had a girlfriend since 7th grade when I was 12-13 (young I know) and that was the only serious\/real relationship I had that lasted, where we actually talked, did things together and kissed\/hugged. But the relationship started from her \"talking\" to me on Facebook through her friend. (Middle school dating is ridiculous.) I just don't know how to get a girlfriend myself. In the movies it's always some confident guy who goes up to the girl and by the end of the movie they have a picture perfect relationship. I know that's obviously not how it works in real life. But how does it work? The cliche advice is \"oh just approach her and start a conversation.\" But I go to a busy high school with 1800+ kids and if I can even manage to find the person, I wouldn't know how to start a conversation. I am almost certain the conversation would go something like this:\n\"Hi\"\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"[I say my name]\"\n\"Why are you talking to me?\"\n\"[Gets overwhelming anxiety and walks away\/chokes on sentence.]\"\nEven if I did say something to that would would I say? \"I'm talking to you because I want to get to know you better, and I like you!\"\nThe honest truth, but it would sound creepy. It doesn't help that I have really bad anxiety around new people to the point where I am allowed to do group activities by myself in another room in school. I don't even talk to any females besides for occasionally online. I avoid all social interaction with new people as much as I can. It's not that I don't want to, I just don't know how. It's the same thing with making new friends. You can't just walk up to people and start talking to them. If you were talking to them about a common interest you know they have wouldn't they just think it's weird that you know that?","chosen":"I don't know how to get a girlfriend.","rejected":"I have no friends, I have anxiety and would really like to get some.

I won't give the whole story as it'd take forever, but I just have huge feelings of doubt for a few main reasons:\n\n(1) we're incompatible in many ways (spend our free time differently; want different things in the future and day to day life; different sexually, mentally, emotionally - we always react to situations completely differently)\n\n(2) we fight a lot (we also have a lot of fun together)\n\n(3) i'm really unhappy in this city and have a lot waiting for me at home (family, friends, coworkers (currently i work from home))\n\n(4) we've discussed the same issues so many times and still fight a lot.\n\nI fantasize about ending it and starting my life anew but can never bring myself to end it. I would be afraid I made the wrong choice and regret it. I would feel so guilty because she's older and would have very small chances of having a kid now, which she really wants. Whenever we nearly break up I can't bring myself to follow through with it, and we make up. I don't know what the F to do or how to do it.","chosen":"I'm scared of ending my long term relationship and I don't know how to do it.","rejected":"how do you determine whether or not to end an engagement?"}
{"prompt":"So I have a friend who I have known since I was about 11, who I have always have had a crush on. She has a really bad history of abusive relationships with guys. Here first real relationship was a textbook example of an abusive relationship, so I feel that she has an inclination to be attracted to or some how attracts guys who are abusive. Anyways, her  and her family have always been close with mine. My younger sister, who is a year younger than both me and the girl, is the girl's best friend. They spend enormous amounts of time together and even planned on moving in together after high-school.\n\nShe has been dating this guy for about 2 years now. From what I know he comes from a very rich family and is pursing a phd in physics . My sister over the course of 2 years of them dating has only meet him once. The girl has also cancelled plans with my sister numerous times to go hang out with him, alone. Every time this has happened she would be about 10 minutes from my house of leaving to come. My sister constantly complains about how he pisses her off and says rude things to her. He cursed my sister out over facebook because her and the girl played a harmless joke on him through text. \nHe has also told her to stop talking to specific people over facebook because they liked her pictures too much.\n\nTo me this seems like another abusive relationship. Knowing her for so long and never meeting this guy worries me and the way he makes her act is very troubling to me. The only thing is I don't know if this is because I have a huge crush on her, or it is because It is what it looks like. And if it is an abusive relationship, what can I do for her? How can I help her?","chosen":"I think my long term crush is in an abusive relationship and I don't know what to do to help.","rejected":"My friend has been dating a guy for 2 years and I have a crush on her for 2 years, but I have never met her.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend says that when he slept with his ex 8 months ago that it meant nothing and there were no emotions involved.

{"prompt":"I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering earlier this year. Recently I got a job as a \"manufacturing engineer intern\" at a small fabrication company near my parents house. Given my poor qualifications, it was probably the best I could do. The pay isn't very good (in fact pretty bad), but there is a benefit to this position - they are promoting me very quickly. It's been just about 3 months and I am already the primary coordinator for a company overhaul and the the expeditor where I walk around making sure everything's running on schedule. I've also been told I will be handling sales within a few months. \n\nBUT, like I said the pay is shit and the more I work here, the less I feel like this position has anything to do with engineering. Even with the promotions, I don't think my pay will reach what entry level engineers receive. So, my dilemma is this: I want to be paid like an engineer, but I feel that this company is giving me experience most engineers would never have the opportunity to get so easily (this is literally my first job). I am continuing to pursue other jobs (although less aggressively and more selectively), but I wonder if this is something I should stick with. Could I get back in the engineering world after I get some cool experience with this company? Am I stuck on this small company, non-engineer career path if I stay? \n\nIf the money was right, I would love to stay here -- I think I'm learning a heck of a lot and my job sounds way more interesting than my corporate engineer friends' jobs. But the pay just doesn't compare and I don't want to give up on my engineering. Maybe I'm misinterpreting what real engineers even do and I can still be considered one.

{"prompt":"I'm a M\/25 and I've always dated my whole life. I don't have a problem meeting people in the slightest. I've had my fair share of casual dating, one night stands, long term relationships and have even been in love. \n\nMy main issue right now is this and I will paraphrase this: On a business trip I met an amazing girl. We went on a few dates and then I went home. However, we stayed in constant contact. I went back on business only this time we spent the night together, had super passionate sex and made our feelings for each other known. However, we both agreed a NY to TX relationship wasn't in our best interest. This girl is perfect for me. We get along and have a great friendship.\n\nHowever, now I am dating a girl and although she is also great...falls extremely short in comparison.

{"prompt":"My sister and I are a few years apart and in our 30s. I am the youngest, she is the oldest. I am trying to figure out the best way to be supportive of her as she is working through her marriage problems. She randomly said she was going to visit for a few days, which caught me off guard. Unfortunately I made the mistake of telling her that I already had plans. I didn't realize until a little later that maybe she was reaching out because she needed to get out of the house and take some time away from her spouse.\n  \nShe recently lost her job a few months ago and is stuck at home in a suburb area. They only have one car (they used to commute together) so I can only imagine how hard it is for her right now to be going through difficulties and stuck at home all day.  \n  \nShe is not the type to reach out to me for help, especially with me being the younger sibling, so I feel bad that I missed out on this opportunity to show her support. I tried to tell her she was welcome to spend some time with me but it might have come across as being too charity-like. I honestly don't know.

{"prompt":"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year now. She explains to me that we have the most incredible sex she has ever had. She loves it so much that she wants to make a pornographic film starring us so that she can masturbate to it when I am out of town. She also wants to make a film so that I do not watch porn as much (meaning that she is ok with making multiple films and doing the crazy stuff). My question to you reddit is, what is the best way of filming yourself having sex? \nI am 100% ok with making the video, but I want it to actually turn out watchable. During sex, we switch positions fairly often. Often times, we move from the bed to the floor or to the desk or to my love seat. Sometimes we incorporate handcuffs and other toys. She likes to be bent over my bedside and she loves to 69. She also loves to cowgirl, blow me, and sometimes sit on my face, so I would think it would not be a great idea to leave my computer's camera on a desk and get up every 10 minutes to adjust the camera angle. I feel like this plan also will not show enough detail if the camera is 10 feet away on my desk. Another idea was to hold the camera and make it more of a POV style, but she says that she wants to see both of our bodies during sex (which i agree with). I want to be able to see her entire body bent over my bed and not just a shaky shot of her ass. I was going to hold the camera for sure while she was blowing me at the end though. Possibly also when she would be reverse cowgirl-ing me. The final idea thrown around was to get a third party to actually film us. She is uncomfortable with the idea of having another individual there, but I am comfortable with the idea only as an absolute last resort. I have been given a gift from god reddit. My girlfriend is willing to do the crazy stuff AND film it. I do not want to mess this up. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

During sex, we switch positions fairly often. Often times, we move from the bed to the floor or to the desk or to my love seat. Sometimes we incorporate handcuffs and other toys. She likes to be bent over my bedside and she loves to 69. She also loves to cowgirl, blow me, and sometimes sit on my face, so I would think it would not be a great idea to leave my computer's camera on a desk and get up every 10 minutes to adjust the camera angle. I feel like this plan also will not show enough detail if the camera is 10 feet away on my desk. Another idea was to hold the camera and make it more of a POV style, but she says that she wants to see both of our bodies during sex (which i agree with). I want to be able to see her entire body bent over my bed and not just a shaky shot of her ass. I was going to hold the camera for sure while she was blowing me at the end though. Possibly also when she would be reverse cowgirl-ing me. The final idea thrown around was to get a third party to actually film us. She is uncomfortable with the idea of having another individual there, but I am comfortable with the idea only as an absolute last resort. I have been given a gift from god reddit. My girlfriend is willing to do the crazy stuff AND film it. I do not want to mess this up. Any advice is greatly appreciated. If it turns out well, maybe I will show some of the commenters :)","chosen":"Need help making a porno of my girlfriend and I having sex.","rejected":"Girlfriend wants to make a porno with me and my boyfriend.

{"prompt":"My SO and I have been dating for several months, and I met his parents and siblings about a month ago, and he met my parents as well. Last weekend my SO and I got kinda drunk and talked honestly about our families' impressions of each other. He said that his parents thought I was nice\/polite and that they want to spend more time with me, and that his youngest siblings (who are in elementary school) think I'm fun. \n\nHowever, he said that his 19 year old sister thinks that I don't like her. Of course that's completely ridiculous, as I can't not like someone who I have barely talked to. Also, if she's anything like my boyfriend, I'll definitely like her. When I met her, we were at her parents' house and she seemed kinda busy with homework, so I said hi to her, had a short conversation about Christmas plans, then I left her alone. \n\nI would think that of all the people in his family, his sister who's closest to me in age would be the easiest to get along with, rather than his parents or his much younger siblings. I asked my boyfriend why she thinks I don't like her, and he seemed as confused as I was. This is especially weird to me, as people who I've just met usually think I'm really nice. Since I really like my SO a lot and plan on being with him for a long time, it really matters to me that his family likes me.\n\nSince we live like 2 hours from his parents, I don't see the family that often, so I don't have any immediate opportunity to be super nice to her.

We both live in the same area, so I said lets go out to dinner sometime whenever she is back in the area.  She said sure, and we went our separate ways.

{"prompt":"Long Post.\n\nHey relationship_advice I need your opinion on a situation that looks complicated too me.  \n\nBack Story:\n\nI met this girl in college we were partners for a project in class, we got along great, she was cute but of course she had a boyfriend.  We both live in the same area, so I said lets go out to dinner sometime whenever she is back in the area.  She said sure, and we went our separate ways.  I honestly never thought I would see her again and didn't even think about it.\n\nFast forward one year later, all of a sudden I get a text saying, \"Hey, Thursday dinner?  It's been to long.\"  We ended up meeting for dinner and it went pretty well from my perspective.  She mentioned her boyfriend briefly and how she is struggling with the fact the he lives 4 hours away.  But most of the conversation we talked about our jobs and I joked about stuff and made her laugh, \"Ha ha, you're so funny.\"  We talked about going out on the town sometime and going hiking during the weekend, but her boyfriend was coming up to see her.  As we were about to leave I said we should have dinner again, and she immediately setup another time next week.\n\nOver the weekend, that her boyfriend was over, she sent me a text at 11PM with just the name of a bar.  I wanted to go meet up but I was an hour away, hanging with my buddies and by the time I drove back to my apartment changed and went out it would have been 1AM, so I texted her back telling her this and haven't heard anything since then.\n\nSo am I reading into things?  If she didn't have a boyfriend, I am pretty sure the signs are telling me she is interested in me, but the fact that she does kinda complicates things.  Am I friend zoned or should I go for it.  Right now I am thinking just F$#$ it and go for it, but maybe you can provide some insight in anything I might have missed.

{"prompt":"Hey Reddit,\nSo about a year and a half ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 2+ years. It was my first real relationship and the first time I ever felt truly in love with someone. The relationship was in no way perfect, in fact it was barely holding together which is why I decided to end it. \nSmall backstory on the relationship,\n-For the entirety of our relationship her parents didn't know about me.\n-She lived with her parents.\n-She was afraid they'd deny her the right to see me if they knew about us.\n-She basically provided for her parents (paid mortgage, etc)\n-I put up with this because I was naive and stupid.\n\nAfter we broke up I was super duper depressed. But I didn't try to get us back together because I still didn't think things could work the way they were. \n\nMy problem is that a year and a half later, I can't seem to get her out of my mind. I haven't talked to her in a year, but still know things about her from time to time because the internet is stupid and it's too god damn easy to find things out. I'm getting better about staying away though.\n\nI still think about her almost every day. When I think about what I want in a relationship, all I picture is her. When I think about wanting to call or text someone to excitedly talk about some new thing I've found out or whatever I think of her. Her phone number is burned forever into my memory because I made myself memorize it when we were together in case of emergencies. (Fun fact, I was waaaaaay more into the relationship than she was apparently).\nI've had two short term relationships since we've broken up. Each one has only lasted a couple months. While they help in easing my mind away from the Ex I can't help comparing those relationships to the big one and finding the small ones faulting.\n\nSo please, any help in getting rid of thoughts about her? Meditation? Lobotomy? Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind machine?\n\nThanks.","chosen":"I can't get over my ex, and I'm starting to see her every day.

Then in late January she somehow remembered that she had drunk sex with someone named Dylan (who is a different from other person she was \"seeing\"). After I found this out I was really upset and somewhat heartbroken. I really wished that she had lost it to me, but I just thought to myself that it is okay because I'm the only one that she will have sex with from now on.

{"prompt":"I am a divorced man of 40, not bad looking and in the 3 years since I split from my ex-wife I have met dozens of women.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, a barmaid in a local pub told me her friend liked me, we exchanged numbers and arranged to go on a date. I could not really remember what she looked like as I had drank quite a lot. I met her the following week and was absolutely blown away by how attractive she was. The date went well and she came back to mine, and we stayed up chatting until the early hours.\n\nI really liked her and we continued to go on dates, or she would come around and we would drink wine, listening music, chat, and have sex.\n\nWe both had said that we don't do relationships; she had an ex-boyfriend she had to see as a business partner, but he would stay at hers' as he lives in a different city. I was dating several other woman at the same time and was open about it with my partner.\n\nBut as time went on I started to fall in love with her and let my emotions rule my mind. I was starting to get jealous about her ex and would sleep with other girls just to make myself feel better.\n\nWe had a fall out on Thursday, so I slept with another girl on Friday night, I sent my partner flowers on Saturday morning and spent all day drinking as I was love sick. She rang and thanked me for the flowers and came to the pub to meet me. We had a couple of drinks and went home for some wine.

{"prompt":"I created this post, and have read through a lot of the comments saying that nuclear power is bad, and most of the reasons why are simply ignorance.\nLet me stress this here, THE PROBLEM IS NOT WITH NUCLEAR POWER, its with the old reactors we are using.\nFor instance, Thorium reactors can't meltdown, can't produce nuclear weapons, they produce power much more cheaply and efficiently than conventional uranium power plants. Thorium is so common that it is an annoyance when digging for more valuable metals. The only reason the world went with uranium instead of thorium is because we all wanted to get nuclear weapons from this too. We knew about this shit in the 1950's for fuck's sake.\nSO DON'T BLAME NUCLEAR POWER, blame your fucktarded governments.\n\nAlso, Bill Gates recently did a TED talk where he described a process that he had simulated which would allow us to react uranium 235, and other waste elements from uranium power plants. Essentially, a way to turn all the radioactive waste that we thought was going to fuck our planet into energy. RIGHT NOW, we have enough nuclear waste to power the Earth for 1000 YEARS.\n\nSo don't get me wrong, I think that the nuclear power plants we have now do have lots of problem, but don't think that that's the case with ALL nuclear power. It is the safest, and most powerful energy source we've created. Coal plants actually put more radioactive elements into the atmosphere. We could fly a fucking plane into a power plant, and it would be fine. \n\nAnd, also, you know, it kinda helps if we don't build these power plants in places where your more or less guaranteed a massive disaster at some point. Just don't be fucking stupid.","chosen":"It's not the nuclear power that's the problem, its our governments.","rejected":"Don't blame nuclear power, its the governments who are fucking stupid."}

{"prompt":"Alright so I've been dating this girl for two weeks, although I've been courting her for at least a month and a half. I know she's younger than me. (consent age in Florida, yadayada, we're in highschool don't freak out) She's really cool and we have a lot of interests in common, and her parents really like me. \n\nSo anyway, today my dad and I had a short conversation about her parents. Come to find out he was worried about her parents liking me, because he'd had a similar situation with my older brother and his first wife. \n\nMy brother's girlfriend's parents always wanted to drive the two of them around and be with them, just like my girlfriend's parents do.\nFor example, my girlfriend had a band competition she needed to go to. I drove to her house and her parents took me to it. They're always inviting me to do things with them through her just like my brother's in laws did. As a guy with no income at the moment (football season, can't get a job) this seemed great to me to save gas and because her parents are legitimately nice people.\n\nThe problem with my brother came when they got married, and her parents still wanted to drive them around and tried to control their lives and tell him what to do. \n\nThis really scared me. I am just exactly the kind of subservient \"nice guy\" that a controlling parent would want for their daughter. I don't want to be stuck in that sort of trap somewhere down the line even if it is a lesser trap just in our current relationship, but I also don't want to alienate her parents if it turns out they are just legitimately nice people. I have not spoken on these feelings with anyone yet.\n\nHow can I find out if her parents want to manipulate me? I've only been out with her once alone, in all the month and a half I've been courting her.

{"prompt":"Hey all, so over the past year or so I have been actively losing weight by changing my diet. I'm a 5'9 male that started at 275 lbs and was cutting and counting calories, losing weight at a solid pace. I have switched up my calorie intake a few times throughout, giving myself a lot of calories in the beginning to start slow but eventually was cutting very hard. I was eating around 1200-1300 calories a day and exercising a few times a week. That went on for a couple months but I realized that while I was losing the weight I wasn't feeling that great and that maybe I was doing more harm than good and decided I needed to eat more.  I have been sitting at around 1500 calories a day for the past couple months with exercise around 4 times a week (mostly cardio) and its been solid. I am down to around 187 lbs and am in some of the best shape I have been in years. Also a lot of people have been giving me compliments and its been nice. That being said, I still want to lose another 15 or so pounds but have started to notice my stomach is really flabby and squishy and have noticeable stretch marks. I have started to weight lift heavy and want to get my last weight lost but also look better aesthetically and not just on the scale. was wondering if I should maybe slow my weight loss to a pound a week so I can keep some of the muscle I have and possibly help out with the skin on my stomach. Was curious if anybody had any similar feelings after losing a lot of weight. Thanks.","chosen":"Lost 85 lbs in just over a year, stomach is flabby and squishy with some quality stretch marks. Started lifting heavy weight, should I up my calories and slow the weight loss?","rejected":"I'm losing weight but I am still not feeling great and I want to not have to see those stretch marks, is that a good idea?"}

{"prompt":"Hi Wedditors! I just got married on Saturday. :) I worked with the most amazing florist. The wedding was in Carmel, CA. However, I was in school the last four years and had to plan nearly everything from Scotland. My husband lived 5 hours south of the florist and didn't know enough about flowers to communicate my ideas to her.  She and I played email tag for 4 months before we could finally meet up, which was 4 weeks before the wedding. I never sent her a deposit before this date, she didn't know any of my ideas, colours, etc. She kept the date open for me and when we discussed everything to get a quote she said she had no minimums. I was a bit stressed out trying to sort flowers out so soon to the wedding, but she has the most amazing personality and calmed me down within seconds. We took a few things off the invoice that weren't very expensive, but we had decided not to do them. I know I did not pay for them, but she had still made the boutonnieres. I called her in confusion (I didn't know what they were or what for) since she beat me to the venue by a full hour and was already at the reception. I said I would double check the invoice and send her a check, but she only said, \"Don't worry about it. Merry Christmas.\" The bouquets and centrepieces were gorgeous. Even without the extra items we didn't pay for I still want to send her a tip, but I doubt she'll cash a check and I don't want to post cash. Any suggestions?

We don't care about each other's flaws, deal with each other's bullshit, have identical sex drives, and are equally silly and lazy.

Maybe that's the wrong term since infatuation might be sexual? I know nothing will further blossom out this admiration, but that doesn't mean I should let it continue until we both go away. I just don't want to be infatuated with her . Idk if you can help me or not or this was all pointless.","chosen":"I'm infatuated with other girl. I have no interest in her romantically.

{"prompt":"Duration of entire relationship: 2 years. \n\nI ended up in a weird and almost fucked up relationship. Basically this girl and I were friends and her boyfriend left to Japan for a semester as a study abroad deal for his photography. What's interesting is that he gave her free reign to hook up with me, and so we did. It got to the point that I realized that I was probably hooked, and it looks like she was too. The boyfriend and her have been having nasty arguments and fights even before Japan. They were fighting in almost every conversation they had, I took nobodies side. I didn't even try to make them break apart, I think it's because I adore the guy as well. He's an awesome kid. It was too late though because I was in love with this girl.

I let them handle it. On the contrary I even gave advice to patch things up between them because I was in a similar situation. Instead she fell in love with me too. I am positive she did.\nSo it all comes down to: He's back from Japan and I just gave her back to him, without a fight. I figured he's her real boyfriend and I would be a traitor to take her away from him. I can't backstab such a good friend. So I went home. I collapsed and just wept and wept for hours. I just couldn't stop. I still can't stop. I don't want to talk with either of them because I know I will not be logical or coherent. I'm positive if I saw them together I would break down and just bawl my eyes out on the spot.\n\nWhat do I do? Nothing is consoling me, my hobbies, my goals, dreams, everything just seems insignificant.

{"prompt":"Me and my ex ended our relationship about 10 days ago. The reason we broke up is because he is too busy for a boyfriend and has a lot of stuff to deal with. We ended the relationship on a good note and have decided to remain friends. He is currently under a lot of pressure as he is graduating in a month, and he is also a part of a lot of clubs at the school and therefore has to give up his positions and find people to replace him. I can tell he is worried about what will happen after graduation, he currently holds a lot of power at the university and he isn't ready to let go of it. \n\nDue to this stress I believe he has turned to drugs to help deal with it. Before we broke up he had only done cocaine twice, with about two to three months between uses. He is a raver and a partier and therefore does drink frequently and does molly frequently. However, since our break-up he has down cocaine three times that I know of. This is a large jump from his previous uses, and I am worried he will become addicted.\n\nHe is not super well off financially and I know a cocaine addiction can and will drain his resources. I am worried about his health, but I believe that this will just end up being a downward spiral for him. I understand he is going through a tough time right now, but I am more worried that if he continues to abuse cocaine he will become addicted, and then once he is through this time he will continue to be a cocaine user. \n\nI have talked to him about his previous cocaine use and told him that I do not believe that it is good, but he didn't feel that it is a big deal. I dropped the subject as I was okay with him doing it infrequently. He doesn't appear to be very open about talking about it. Am I valid for wishing to talk to him about my concerns? Or should I wait and see if once he is less stressed he stops his use?","chosen":"my friend (18M) is using cocaine a lot more often than he used it before our relationship ended.

{"prompt":"So I met a girl before winter break,(we will call her 'Sarah') (we are both in college, but we are 2 hours away from each other) and everything went great since we both had feelings for each other.  When I left to head back to my school, she told me that she didn't know if she wanted a relationship or not and she would let me know after break (this was 2 weeks before finals).  So, I tried to talk to her all winter break, but since she lives on a farm and took some online classes, she only responded a couple of times, but since her best friends didn't get a lot back, I didn't feel as bad.\n\nBefore I met her or anything, I was talking to another girl, but only talking.  I had almost everything in common with her and I kind of liked it at the time.  So, during the whole winter break I constantly talked to her about anything.

{"prompt":"My mom and I have never gotten along. I was her first child, and I was subject to a lot of verbal abuse, minor physical abuse, and constant manipulation etc while growing up. I was beaten before I was big enough to defend myself, told what a terrible ungrateful person I was on a regular basis, that I was a mistake etc... You get the picture. When I moved out several years ago I limited my contact with her to letters or emails. After a couple of years it seemed like she may have overcome a lot of her issues with me so I reestablished contact. This led to one of her worst episodes and me cutting off communication with her completely. I have no contact with her at this point though she hopes to reestablish our relationship in the future.\n\nI am very close with my younger siblings, and will spend time with them when I can. I feel very protective of them and try to reaffirm their worth, and that they are loved etc. because I believe not having that knowledge while growing up has scarred me to this day.

{"prompt":"One night i decided to go out for a one night stand.  I was by myself on my college campus at the bars when I ran into a friend. She was hammered,but she introduced me to two friends she was with. We'll call them james and matt.  I was immediately attracted to james. We talked for about 15 minutes, had so many similar interests. Physically, he was just my type. And he was a little awkward, which was a turn on for me. I honestly didn't even care about getting laid anymore. I only wanted to get his number, maybe make out a little, and get to know him better. It's rare for me to develop a crush on someone, but me and him hit it off and there was so much chemistry. \n\nAnd then I fucked it all up. I had one too many drinks. I was very drunk, and the bar was closing. I told my james, matt, and my friend that i was heading home. James and Matt started discussing (arguing?) about who would take me home. I was halfway to the door, and I guess Matt won out in the end. He grabbed my hand and started to lead me away. I got a glance at james's face. I was too drunk to realize he looked hurt at the time. That night, I fucked matt. After we finished I had sobered up a bit. I was devastated.

She also seems to kinda disregard me at times.\n\nA while back I said I didn't feel wanted a whole lot. And kind of explained some of this to her. And she took it really hard and was kinda mad. I think had I pressed any more we would have broken up.  \n\nThe thing is though, she has a lot of things I like, she is a natural leader, she is independent, we are both old fashioned and have the same values (which is very important to me as a lot of girls don't tend to care for or oppose a lot of my beliefs). She does make me happy when I am with her for the most part. And we have a lot of good memories. She also is always there for me when I am down. \n\nI guess what I am asking is, am I expecting too much? If I was to break up with her it would still really suck, but I don't want to waste her time if she isn't able to give me what I need. But if I am I want to figure out why I am not content and get there.","chosen":"Am I expecting too much from my SO?","rejected":"I'm not sure if I am expecting too much from my SO"}

{"prompt":"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months now, and things were going really well. We hadn't fought, have been open and honest with each other, and enjoy being around each other. She is an excellent person; compassionate, caring, very funny, and beautiful. We said \"I love you\" a few months back, so it did move a little quick in comparison to some of my past relationships.\n\nA few weeks ago, she had a conversation with me that she thought that I wasn't as into the relationship as she was. I assured her that I cared for her, it's just we express it in different ways. She expresses how she feels in actions, and I tend to use words. Despite assuring her that I do love her, that conversation stuck with me. When I went to visit my parent's home last weekend (which is about 6 hours away), I had a lot of time to think about where I really was in the relationship, and I realized that I may not as into it. What really stood out to me was the fact that I didn't think to hang out with her (she asked me) when I was driving home even though I had free time (we only see each other about 2-3 times per week). \n\nAlthough this may not seem like a lot to some people, given the previous conversation, I thought on it. When I saw her, I told her what I was feeling (or rather not feeling). Needless to say, we had a long discussion about where we thought this relationship was going, and I was honest that I didn't know if I wanted it to become more serious.

{"prompt":"A few weeks ago, I had a dream I was driving with some friends westbound across the I-90 bridge into Seattle. At the time, the bridge was about 80-100 feet above the water and only the middle express lane existed. As we first pull onto the bridge, we noticed a huge green military tanker jet clip a wing into Lake Washington near the other side. After it crashed, everyone flipped out and stopped their cars to try and help survivors. \n\nAs people on the west side of the bridge were trying to help passengers get out of the water, we were trying to rescue a bunch of dogs on our side. The only problem was that we didn't know how to help the dogs get out of the water since we were so far above them. I looked farther down the bridge to see what others were doing, and sure enough these dogs would just fucking launch themselves out of the water and try to land in the arms of people 80+ feet above. \n\nI look down again and sure enough there is a smaller white dog that starts shooting up toward me. I catch it, and I swear it had the most fucked up face I have ever seen. It had beady black eyes, thick wool, and a wrinkly flat face that resembled an old man. It also had a bunch of sharp and sticky plants stuck all throughout its fur which made it really difficult to hold.\n\nThe thing is shaking and cold, so naturally I feel bad for it and all of us decide we should keep it. I open the hatch to my SUV, shove it against a bunch of luggage, and close the door just in time for nothing to fall out.

{"prompt":"I've been dating my GF for about 2 months now. Before we were in a relationship it was a great time all around, we had lots of fun and went out together at least twice a week. She's a very busy person with schooling, volunteers, work and friends but we were getting along great. I have been in the dating pool for a few months now and have dated lots of people, none have ever clicked as well as this girl and I did. On our 8th date I asked her if she'd like to be exclusive, she said she did, we both seemed to really like eachother and that made me pretty stoked. Well, since then we've seen each other twice for like a grand total of four hours. She's busy and I knew that going into it, but on top of her being busy, she doesn't seem to want to try and organize anything in general. \n\nSince we've started dating I've asked her if she wanted to hang out 5 times in 2 weeks, she's said she is busy 4 of those times and has only agreed once. She will apologize for not being able to hang out but won't try to reschedule. It makes me feel fairly rejected and I'm not happy with it at all. I've stopped asking her to hang out in hopes that she'll be the one to initiate it and nothing has happened yet. Earlier today I was particularly wanting to be flirty and try to engage something so I texted her, \"You still owe me that kiss\" (she does) and she replied \"I'm sorry\". I haven't even responded to it because it feels like it's just on a loop.\n\nI can't ask her to change her life and I don't want to make her feel bad about it. How do I go about fixing this? Do I talk to her and say that I need her to be more clear about when she can spend time with me? Isn't that demanding? I'm honestly pretty terrible at relationships and I really don't want to act like an asshole.","chosen":"GF doesn't seem to want to hang out anymore, it's not working.

{"prompt":"I was playing in the large side yard at my babysitter's house, she had a long driveway that went along the side of it.

At the time I was scared but didn't quite understand exactly how bad the situation could have been. There had been other attempted abductions at a park nearby, no one was actually taken that I know of. This guy was not really very good at not being creepy as fuck.

{"prompt":"First post. Been lurking for two months. I love reddit's insight on these types of situations and I'm sure I'm not alone in this situation.\n\nAnyway, I'm 22 and graduating with a degree in French\/minor in Marketing from an 'eh' state university. I've ran the educational gamut: from Film to Electrical Engineering to Finance to where I am now.

{"prompt":"A few months before undergrad ended (I graduated two weeks ago), I (22\/M) started dating an acquaintance (22\/F) whom I had known for years but had never interacted with. The relationship \"just happened\" to some extent, and we did tons of activities together, and had a pretty awesome time.\n\nNow I don't claim to be an expert on relationships, but I've dated a few people [seriously] in the past, and have a fair sense of what kind of woman I am looking for what what kind of woman I am compatible with, and I feel like the relationship had tons of potential in that regards.\nSo here's the problem: upon graduation, in a few months, we will both be working in different areas (WA and CA), and this has been long established. I'm usually a very logical person, and can make decisions rationally without emotions getting in the way. I decided shortly before graduation that a long distance relationship, especially for an indefinite period of time and with only a few months of foundation, would have a low probability of succeeding.

Usually wouldn't care, but text said something along the lines of \"hope you liked my snapchat ;) ;)\"  I was curious, and even though I shouldn't have looked at their conversation.  Leading up to his text he brought up his penis and although she said hey now calm down I have a bf, she still flirted and complimented his penis.  Then said we just have to be freinds if anything.  I didn't see the snapchat, but she had yet to respond to his snapchat text although she did open the snap I guess yesterday.  If it was something sexual like I suspect, she should have definitely texted him when she opened it that that was not OK and that they could no longer be friends if that was what he wanted.  She didn't do that, just left it blank.

She flirts with him back, acts like she's been flirting back, but isn't.  Should I bring it up to her tonight or should I let it go?"}
{"prompt":"So today in the morning I clicked on my gf's phone to check the time and saw a text from someone she used to hook up with.  Usually wouldn't care, but text said something along the lines of \"hope you liked my snapchat ;) ;)\"  I was curious, and even though I shouldn't have looked at their conversation.  Leading up to his text he brought up his penis and although she said hey now calm down I have a bf, she still flirted and complimented his penis.  Then said we just have to be freinds if anything.  I didn't see the snapchat, but she had yet to respond to his snapchat text although she did open the snap I guess yesterday.  If it was something sexual like I suspect, she should have definitely texted him when she opened it that that was not OK and that they could no longer be friends if that was what he wanted.  She didn't do that, just left it blank.  That is what worries me, because I know my gf is fairly attractive and is going to get hit on, but I need to know that she'll set boundaries and let ppl know whats not ok.  I'm planning to bring it up to her tonight, by just asking her to see her phone and asking her why she felt the need to have this conversation (especially the flirting and the complimenting) b\/c she should not have led him on at all, she should've stopped it when it became sexual.

{"prompt":"About a year ago, My father was asked for $1000 from someone he vaguely knew from his work (from which he recently retired). He gave his story which was the very vague \"I've fallen on some hard times, and need the money to cover this months rent\".My dad is one of those people who just wants to please everyone, and very seriously considered helping this man. In the end, we had to say no. a $1000 isn't insignificant for us, and though he may have been able to afford it. We didn't know this man very well, and thought that if he were credible, he wouldn't be asking an acquaintance, he would be going to closer friends or family. He asked me what I would do in this situation and I told him this.\n\nFor me, unless it was my brother, or one of 6 close friends (those six and I have been very close for 15 years), if I couldn't afford it, i would say no right away. If I could, I would not lend them a substantial amount of money unless they had proven to me that they really needed it.

{"prompt":"Hello there!\n\nI'm trying to get back into the habit of working out, but finding myself struggling a lot more than I expected.

{"prompt":"Some background on the dog first, we adopted a 3 year old Chow mix in february and has been a great dog apart from some lack of training (no training in those 3 years) and is very loving and always wants attention and to be petted.  He also gets walks fairly often and he likes being outside.  He has had some trouble with other dogs but he mostly ignores them now.  These past few weeks he has been acting strangely at night however.  He used to only sleep in his crate, even when we let him have freedom to choose where he sleeps, but now he sleeps either behind the door of my sisters room or behind the couch.  Then when you touched the door or couch in the slightest he would start to growl and show teeth.  I have been putting him in his crate when he would do that.   Today however, while watching Tv he randomly gets out from behind the couch and starts snarling and being aggressive towards me and my sister.  I got up and grabbed by the collar and he whipped his head around and clipped me with his fang, not trying to bite but more of a head motion deal.  After that he tried to go into my parents room and ran to grab a treat to attempt to calm him down (I knew i shouldnt have).  I then put him in his crate and he laid down and slept like normal.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend \"John\" (16) and me have been together for 3 month now. I know this is not long at all and we are young and make mistakes but please hear me out. We're in our last year of highschool and everything's going pretty fine in our relationship. \nWe treat each other respectfully, we have common interests, we communicate whenever there is something the other doesn't like. \nI used to be emotionally unstable before, unlike other girls I don't hate my body, I hate my personality. I didn't believe anyone would find me interesting at all, especially after the end of my first relationship that lasted 6months and ended with my ex finding me too boring.\n\nJohn is a very positive person. His positive aura has made me into a very happy and relaxed person as well. I feel desired and loved and I am happier than ever. \nNow the problem is he taught me to relax and not be a workaholic and enjoy my teenage life as I will never be this young again. And now that I am, I feel a lot less focused at school and everywhere else, I can't organize, I do everything wrong where I used to have a clear mind. I can't focus. All I think about is when I will see him again, when I can be my happiest again. \nIt's the last year of highschool so grades do matter. But there's no way I want to end this beautiful relationship over this. This is also a thing I do not know how to tell him. I don't want to be obsessive. There ARE still many other things I enjoy without him: painting, playing instruments, programming and all these other non-lazy hobbies I had before. But I am so extremely demotivated at school and can't seem to listen to what the teacher says and my time management is almost completely gone. I only want to see him during the break. It feels so wrong to only go to school because of this. Any way to make me less\u2026 addicted?

{"prompt":"My wife and I were at a family gathering over the weekend. Father in law has a really big thing for blonde women, which is interesting because his wife is brunette.

{"prompt":"24m My gf and I have been dating a little over a year, things have been great up until last December. The relationship started out amazing, I am a really shy guy and had not been dating for 5 years prior, but I was encouraged by some friends to ask this girl out. Turns out we had a lot of the same interests, were both huge geeks at heart. \nWhen things got hot and heavy we moved mountains, the frequency and quality of sex was mind blowing. This lasted up until December, then she started avoiding physical contact, I didn't think much of it until just recently. Since January she has been very busy with school and work, I only get to see her maybe once a week, we talk every day but when I finally do see her, nothing much happens, maybe have dinner, talk some, but she has gone cold to any physical advances.\nThe other day I was saying how things have been a little cold compared to the norm, she acknowledged this and then threw herself at me. Not in a good way though, it seemed like she was doing it just for me. I could tell that she was faking the whole thing and had to put the brakes on it. All of this has made me very depressed, what have I done to destroy the spark? She claims it is school and her busy schedule, and things will be normal in a few months. But there are days where she comes to me all happy and full of energy, only to shut me down after I receive mixed signals.\nI really do not want to be the boyfriend who only wants sex, but that is what it is starting to feel like.

Shortly after moving in we began experiencing loud neighbor noises from upstairs\u2014the typical heavy stomping (sometimes in heels), loud gatherings, early Saturday morning phone calls taken on the fire escape, and then some that take extra effort, like they're dropping heavy weights on the floor like \"fuck setting this weight down, I'll let gravity do that.\" It's in every room\u2014there's no escaping the stomps and thuds and sometimes repetitive sex noises. Even now as I write this I hear their muffled conversations coming through my ceiling\u2014a high ceiling.

We're both a bit lazy I suppose, but also I want to get it right\u2014especially when I see neighbor notes\/notes on cars\/notes on refrigerators\/etc end up on Reddit, torn apart (figuratively).

Maybe they need a well-written **note** to let it really marinate. That's where you come in: what do I say? What don't I say? My biggest fear is that they'll stomp even louder in protest, so I don't want to come off as a jerk. I also don't want to come off as some sort of pussy to be trifled with.

{"prompt":"I dated this girl for a couple of months but we really connected in the short time we spent together. Or so I thought. Early in the new year she broke up with me citing that she wasn't ready for a relationship after having gotten out of a long term relationship shortly before we met. She broke up with me through text. Left my belongings in my mailbox and has refused to talk to me in person. I've come to realize how incompatible her and I were but I still struggle from day to day with the break up even a month later. \n\nI see her almost every day because unfortunately we live on the same street, but when she sees me she pretends I don't exist. When she walks past my house she makes a point to look the other way.

Thus, I have quite a bit of experience in customer service, and do my job quite well.\n\nWhen it comes to technology, though, I have little-to-no formal experience or education. I've had a passion for technology from a young age. Using software and troubleshooting is almost second nature to me and I learn new concepts quickly.\n\nSo I ask: with my history, how can I go about getting an entry level Help Desk job to get my feet wet? There is a posting on Indeed for a similar position at a local theme and water park. What should I include in my cover letter? How can I set myself apart from others that do have experience? Am I even cut out for a job like this? If not, what can I do to prepare for it?","chosen":"how can I get an entry-level IT job with little-to-no formal experience\/education?","rejected":"I have a few years of experience, but I'm not sure where to go with this career. Help!\n\nThanks!"}
{"prompt":"I[F\/22] started dating Mondo[M\/29] at the end of last year. Things seemed pretty good and I really did like him. We shortly moved in together and I eventually found my biological dad on Facebook. So I decided to go to Michigan to meet my dad Edward[M\/48] for the first time. When I was in Michigan Mondo[M\/29] was giving me a hard time for being out in Michigan for 6 weeks.. So to make things a little easier I broke off the relationship. The whole time I was in Michigan he would act pretty childish and would ask me everyday to be his girlfriend and my answer would be no, so that would result in him getting mad at me and hanging up on me. \n\nWhen I got back to California from my trip I decided to go to the apartment to pick up my belongings and a bunch of my shit ended up missing but didn't want to make a big deal about it. He made it a point for us to talk about what happened and soon decided that we should hangout again. Things were good at first and soon I realized this wasn't a good idea bcuz he was drinking too much and started to do heavier drugs. He started to develop an unhealthy lifestyle and I basically cut ties with him. We got into a ugly argument which resulted in us to say stupid shit.. About 5 days after the fight he decided to show up to my house uninvited and scared the crap out of my sister Vivian[F\/19].. All he was doing was knocking on door and her bedroom window.\n\nThankfully I wasn't home that night and was staying with my mom Teresa[F\/42].. The next day he demanded that I apologize for my comments in the augment and I didn't.. He then threatened to show up to my mom's house..

I was suprised by how accurate and insightful the teacher's feedback was. \n\nAt the end of the workshop we drank some wine and the teacher made some sexual remarks towards me. I ignored them. Two glasses later she berated the housewife for not dealing with her marriage problems and mocked the aroma therapist and aroma therapy in general.

{"prompt":"My long distance girlfriend of 2 years dumped me a couple of weeks ago. We'd see each other a couple times a month and talked daily when we were dating.  I felt her growing cold towards me and I reached out the most during the last month before she broke up with me. I was ready to move, etc. The week she dumped me she said she was too comfortable with me and she needed someone more dangerous (I'm boring I guess?). She said she needed space as well. I tried to give it to her. She proceeded to text\/call me every other day and came and saw me within that  5 day period.  After she left my house I was miserable. 4 days later I received a call. I played it cool and got off the phone asap. The next day she sent me a picture of one of those summer coke bottles with my name on it. I went to 3 stores to find one with her name and returned with a pic. She didn't know I went to three stores, but I thought it was a romantic gesture. Instant cold. She responded negatively. The next day, July 4, I went to my uncle's house and left my phone at home charging. When I got home there were 9 missed calls, 9 texts, 2 silent voice mails, and one sobbing voicemail.  The gist was she said she needed me there, she wishes things were like they were in the beginning, etc. I called her back asking if she meant everything she said and she said \"some of it\".

{"prompt":"Jon (M27) and I (F27) have been together for three years and lived together for two. Jon is great at physically and verbally showing his love. He tells me up to 10x a day he loves me and is very affectionate (big hugs, kisses, etc) all the time. \n\nI reciprocate this verbal and physical affection, but I'm also very thoughtful & do a lot of acts of service. I leave him love notes all over the house. I surprise him with his home-cooked favorite lunch. I do his laundry without him asking. I buy him a video game he wants for no reason. I do these things because I love him and want to express it. \n\nFor the past year, I've been asking if he could also be thoughtful towards me. For example, I was out visiting my family on the east coast for a few months and I asked him if he could write me a letter because it would mean a lot to me\/be thoughtful. He never did. I go as far as to *tell* him thoughtful things he could do for me.

She has told me that she is very uncomfortable with me living with girls. She lives about an hour away from my campus so we can typically see each other once or twice a week and on weekends. She has told me that she doesn't like that other girls will get to be with me every day when she can only see me a few times a week.\n\nIt comes across as jealousy even though I've told her many times that these girls and I are strictly friends and I have zero interest in any of them. She's very dismissive when we try to talk about it and says things like \"I don't want to hear your explanations\" and that I'm a \"dick\" for not sympathizing with her.

{"prompt":"Just a little back story:\nI compete at an elite level in an individual sport. I was in Sweden last weekend and met a lot of people over there. I thought I'd try out a few things with a girl I had seen before, she looked like she was a lot of fun. The only thing I was doing was looking in her eyes and smiling, sometimes even blinking. Though she smiled back I wasn't getting a real big response and seeing as she had much attention from other guys I thought she wasn't interested. Not a big deal. Her loss for not meeting someone awesome.\nThese competitions always end with a Banquet and a party afterwards.

{"prompt":"So I met this girl on OK Cupid. I wasn't really expecting too much after another date where we just did not click.\n\nWe go to a couple of bars and then I invite her back to my place to smoke a joint and hang out. We get along great, she's funny and smart and I think we're having a good time. She says she's getting tired and should head home and I offer up my bed to her and I'll sleep on the couch. One thing leads to another and we end up sleeping together. She leaves in the morning and we text a little bit throughout the weekend and I say I'd love to see her again soon. So we make plans for Monday.\n\nToday rolls around and at around 5 or 6 she says her family (who do live close by) are actually coming to visit so she has to cancel. I ask for a rain check and she says how about Friday. I say that sounds great.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I've been texting her too much and coming on too strong. I don't really care which way this goes. If it was a one night stand or she just wants a real casual situation that's cool, but it's confusing for me and I can't stop thinking about the disappointment that may happen if she bails on Friday too. I don't want to freak her out by asking her what the situation is, but it's really frustrating.","chosen":"Girl I'm seeing wants to hang out on Friday but cancels at 5pm. I have a plan to hang out.

{"prompt":"Hey everyone,\n\nNot sure which subreddit is the right place to ask this question, but I figured this was a good start. I have a 2-year old standard schnauzer named Pepper. She is a very headstrong, feisty dog. We tried our best to train her (and are still trying) and have gotten trainers and behaviorists.... she still has a lot of issues, though, including pulling immensely on the leash, especially when in the presence of small furry creatures like squirrels and bunnies. She knows tricks well but not the best with behavior...\n\nAnyway, in regard to WALKING with Pepper, we stopped using her standard leash and collar (around her neck) and started using a harness. However, Pepper is prone to hip dysplasia and her dog parents have a moderate case of it, so the behaviorist told us that would exacerbate it and make it worse. She recommended we move to the Gentle Leader, which we did. She even fitted it for us. Pepper hates the gentle leader though and is constantly still pulling and trying to get it off with her paws and rubbing her face in the grass. I feel bad! My fiance's parents recommended a choke collar, so my fiance tries that but I still don't feel comfortable using it. We have tried to no avail with all different leashes and techniques to stop the pulling.\n\nNow, since the nice weather has arrived and Pepper is old enough, I have started jogging with her a little. Because I don't want to hurt her face with the Gentle Leader jogging, or her body with the harness, I am using the traditional leash and collar. We jog for about 20 - 40 minutes on average. She always wants to sprint (especially if she sees a small creature) and pulls crazily on the leash while jogging. She ends up choking and making rasping noises for half the job because she is choking herself. I feel like I may be doing permanent damage or hurting her. Can anyone give me advice on what kind of leash to use for jogging so that Pepper can enjoy and not be hurt or injured?

{"prompt":"I had an abortion last spring due to being a poor, university student with no plans on being pregnant, and my boyfriend not holding down entry-level jobs. It was a topic of heated debate between my boyfriend and myself because he wanted the baby. We were living together at the time and things weren't perfect but we did love each other and still love each other very much to this day\n\nOkay I'm going to skip a lot of the details and get straight to the point. He was morally against it, unlike myself. I never had any conflicting emotions about the abortion and I didn't feel any regret afterwards. I considered all the emotions someone on the opposite coin would feel and I realized that came down to seeing life for not what it is.

{"prompt":"So I'm a 21 year old guy in the UK, and I've been single since I was 18. I'm in love with my best friend (21F). We've known each other for 10 years, and we've been best friends for about 5. I'm not sure if she has any idea how I feel about her. We make each other laugh, and she's told me that I'm the only guy she's close to. She doesn't have many close friends due to being very shy.\n\nNow we're both going back for our final year in university (two different ones) next week, and it's likely I won't see her until Christmas. I don't know if I should ask her to hang out this weekend, just the two of us. I get the feeling she does return my feelings in some shape or form, but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nMy confidence hasn't been great since I ended things with my ex (she didn't like that I was speaking to another girl), and although I've had short flings since then, I've never really committed to anything since.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Should I at least see if she wants to do something? We've hung out alone a few times, and we enjoy each other's company, but I'm worried that I might be overstepping her boundaries by doing this. Should I just take the plunge? All our friends ask me why we're not together, and I imagine they ask her too, so it can't just be me that thinks we'd work out. She's never had a boyfriend, has confirmed she's straight, and generally keeps herself to herself, except when she's around me and a few other friends.","chosen":"I'm in love with my best friend, but I'm not sure what to do.

{"prompt":"Long story short, a guy [20M] that I [22F] previously disliked has gained my respect and I'm willing to try my luck in obtaining a date with him.\n\nI met him through my good friends, and while they support me in my decision to pursue something with him, I guess I just need unbiased confirmation that I'm not being a total creep by asking him out. (If I am being a creep, PLEASE let me know!)\n\nHe practically worships hockey, the sport that I know very little about.  My ideal first date is to go ice skating, but perhaps I should consider inviting him to a hockey game instead? Joining him in his comfort zone?\n\nMy biggest question is how should I go about with the actual asking part?

{"prompt":"Long story short, a guy [20M] that I [22F] previously disliked has gained my respect and I'm willing to try my luck in obtaining a date with him.\n\nI met him through my good friends, and while they support me in my decision to pursue something with him, I guess I just need unbiased confirmation that I'm not being a total creep by asking him out. (If I am being a creep, PLEASE let me know!)\n\nHe practically worships hockey, the sport that I know very little about.  My ideal first date is to go ice skating, but perhaps I should consider inviting him to a hockey game instead? Joining him in his comfort zone?\n\nMy biggest question is how should I go about with the actual asking part?
