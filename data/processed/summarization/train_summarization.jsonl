I have an ongoing medical issue I am trying to work out with my doctors and specialists, and I let my GF know if I've made an appointment regarding something that has happened recently because I think she at least deserves to know im going to the doctor because (insert reason) happened. Most of the times I tell her this, she tells me what she thinks is wrong with me and sometimes will suggest that I do 'X' whether that is take some over the counter drug, insist that my doctor ruin some test or even to the point one time where she will try to get me to take a prescription drug prescribed to her mom for the issue that she thinks I also have.

Because of that I will usually get defensive as i am not asking for help, just letting her know I am going to the doctor and we argue about it.

How can I communicate about this without being confrontational, or am I in the wrong for getting defensive ( totally fine with that if it's the case ).

{"prompt":"My original post is [here](\n\nA few days after posting this, I received a call at work from a neighbor, my fiance was trying to fill a forged prescription at Jewel.

I don't claim to be the smartest or most abstract thinker in the world, surely I can't be alone in coming to this idea, so what is wrong with it?\n\nI thought at first that maybe the notion of rubber bullets isn't usually raised due to the injuries that they can cause, but then I realised death is usually a fatal injury. Also, I don't imagine tasers would necessarily be orgasmic for the victim, albeit less fatal than metal bullets.\n\nSo, why are we not discussing this? Why are rubber bullets not a good idea?","chosen":"Why are we not discussing the idea of rubber bullets?","rejected":"Why is no one raising the issue of rubber bullets?"}
{"prompt":"I originally was expecting to move into my new apartment in August, but due to some instability at the time, I was forced to stay with a friend and wait until this month to move in. Today, I received a message from them asking if I was still moving in, and responded that I was since I was receiving my bi-weekly paycheck that would give me enough to pay this month's rent of about $350 (along with a few necessities).\nThey then proceeded to tell me that if I did move in, I would also have to pay the whole first month's rent on top of that, even though I wasn't even living there. I would understand a holding fee, but paying $350 just to hold a spot is utterly ridiculous. I've done the math, and by the time I do get the full $700 or so, it would be time for next month's rent, which would add another $350 on top of that. That means I would essentially have to earn over $1000 in less than a month, literally impossible for someone on my salary.\nAnd here's the icing on the cake; if I decide NOT to move in, they still want to charge me full rent for August AND September. Regardless of what I do, I'll still be down at least $700.\n\nI could really use some help\/advice, guys. I'm at a loss at this point.

{"prompt":"So Reddit, I'm getting kind of desperate. I love my father very much, and I'm starting to get horribly worried about him. \n\nHe works twelve hour days on average, being the manager at an office supplies store. There have been times when he worked forty hours in *three days*. He hardly eats at work, since he's so completely busy and understaffed. (His company won't let him hire more employees) He's lost around twenty-thirty pounds since he only ever eats dinner. In general, his company and his employee's are screwing him over. Whenever one of his employee's skips out on my father, my dad has to step in. And he can't do anything about it. We can't afford for him to quit his job of ten years right now either.\n\nThe worst part is that he's seemed to turn to alcohol and cigarettes to help cope. On average he drinks six-eight beers a night, and I have no idea how many cigarettes he smokes on average since he does it in secret even though he knows I know. He refuses to go to the doctor either, so I have no idea how much this affects him. This has been going on for about 2-4 years now.\n\nI've tried confronting him about his problem two or three times, and sometimes he promises he'll stop, and other times he's simply annoyed at me. I'm terrified it's affecting his health- I would never be able to forgive myself if something happened to him because I was too scared to speak up. I'll be honest here, I have a history of depression. As I am right now, I don't think I would be able to live without my father.","chosen":"My father's work is completely screwing him over, and he's turned to alcohol and cigarettes as a result. I just... want advice. Anything would be appreciated.","rejected":"I need advice on how best to handle my father's alcoholism and how to help my father cope with his loss of weight."}

{"prompt":"Been seeing a girl for 6 months. Get along real well with her and have no complaints so far. We were sitting down one day, and the conversation about \"What would you name your kids?\" came up. I offered mine, and she gave her opinions on them, what she liked, what she didn't. That's cool. So I asked about hers. I said I wasn't much of a fan regarding one of the names she mentioned, and she came back with a \"Well, I'd be the one carrying the baby, so it's not like you would have a choice.\"\n\nWhen I dug deeper, she cited that because it's the woman who has to go through the pregnancy and everything that comes with it, so it's only fair that she gets final say in naming her future child. I would never argue what a woman has to go through vs what a man has too. But it's not like the man just sits there and eats popcorn while everything is going on! Plus, it's also raising the child that's important too ya know? \n\nAnyways, I never thought I'd come across a situation like this. I sort of get it, but at the same time it leaves a bad taste in my mouth that she can just freely disregard the names I would ever suggest, and take very little input from me regarding what she wants.

{"prompt":"So I met this girl at my school about a year ago. My first impressions of her was wow she's really pretty but i never had the intention of looking for a relationship back then.

{"prompt":"I don't really know how to format this post because it's all just random thoughts so I here goes.\nI don't know if this is the right sub reddit to post this too either, so sorry if it's not.\n\nAnyway, here it is.\nI'm 16, in 10th grade on high school. I haven't had a girlfriend since 7th grade when I was 12-13 (young I know) and that was the only serious\/real relationship I had that lasted, where we actually talked, did things together and kissed\/hugged. But the relationship started from her \"talking\" to me on Facebook through her friend. (Middle school dating is ridiculous.) I just don't know how to get a girlfriend myself. In the movies it's always some confident guy who goes up to the girl and by the end of the movie they have a picture perfect relationship. I know that's obviously not how it works in real life. But how does it work? The cliche advice is \"oh just approach her and start a conversation.\" But I go to a busy high school with 1800+ kids and if I can even manage to find the person, I wouldn't know how to start a conversation. I am almost certain the conversation would go something like this:\n\"Hi\"\n\"Who are you?\"\n\"[I say my name]\"\n\"Why are you talking to me?\"\n\"[Gets overwhelming anxiety and walks away\/chokes on sentence.]\"\nEven if I did say something to that would would I say? \"I'm talking to you because I want to get to know you better, and I like you!\"\nThe honest truth, but it would sound creepy. It doesn't help that I have really bad anxiety around new people to the point where I am allowed to do group activities by myself in another room in school. I don't even talk to any females besides for occasionally online. I avoid all social interaction with new people as much as I can. It's not that I don't want to, I just don't know how. It's the same thing with making new friends. You can't just walk up to people and start talking to them. If you were talking to them about a common interest you know they have wouldn't they just think it's weird that you know that?","chosen":"I don't know how to get a girlfriend.","rejected":"I have no friends, I have anxiety and would really like to get some.

I won't give the whole story as it'd take forever, but I just have huge feelings of doubt for a few main reasons:\n\n(1) we're incompatible in many ways (spend our free time differently; want different things in the future and day to day life; different sexually, mentally, emotionally - we always react to situations completely differently)\n\n(2) we fight a lot (we also have a lot of fun together)\n\n(3) i'm really unhappy in this city and have a lot waiting for me at home (family, friends, coworkers (currently i work from home))\n\n(4) we've discussed the same issues so many times and still fight a lot.\n\nI fantasize about ending it and starting my life anew but can never bring myself to end it. I would be afraid I made the wrong choice and regret it. I would feel so guilty because she's older and would have very small chances of having a kid now, which she really wants. Whenever we nearly break up I can't bring myself to follow through with it, and we make up. I don't know what the F to do or how to do it.","chosen":"I'm scared of ending my long term relationship and I don't know how to do it.","rejected":"how do you determine whether or not to end an engagement?"}
{"prompt":"So I have a friend who I have known since I was about 11, who I have always have had a crush on. She has a really bad history of abusive relationships with guys. Here first real relationship was a textbook example of an abusive relationship, so I feel that she has an inclination to be attracted to or some how attracts guys who are abusive. Anyways, her  and her family have always been close with mine. My younger sister, who is a year younger than both me and the girl, is the girl's best friend. They spend enormous amounts of time together and even planned on moving in together after high-school.\n\nShe has been dating this guy for about 2 years now. From what I know he comes from a very rich family and is pursing a phd in physics . My sister over the course of 2 years of them dating has only meet him once. The girl has also cancelled plans with my sister numerous times to go hang out with him, alone. Every time this has happened she would be about 10 minutes from my house of leaving to come. My sister constantly complains about how he pisses her off and says rude things to her. He cursed my sister out over facebook because her and the girl played a harmless joke on him through text. \nHe has also told her to stop talking to specific people over facebook because they liked her pictures too much.\n\nTo me this seems like another abusive relationship. Knowing her for so long and never meeting this guy worries me and the way he makes her act is very troubling to me. The only thing is I don't know if this is because I have a huge crush on her, or it is because It is what it looks like. And if it is an abusive relationship, what can I do for her? How can I help her?","chosen":"I think my long term crush is in an abusive relationship and I don't know what to do to help.","rejected":"My friend has been dating a guy for 2 years and I have a crush on her for 2 years, but I have never met her.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend says that when he slept with his ex 8 months ago that it meant nothing and there were no emotions involved.

{"prompt":"I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering earlier this year. Recently I got a job as a \"manufacturing engineer intern\" at a small fabrication company near my parents house. Given my poor qualifications, it was probably the best I could do. The pay isn't very good (in fact pretty bad), but there is a benefit to this position - they are promoting me very quickly. It's been just about 3 months and I am already the primary coordinator for a company overhaul and the the expeditor where I walk around making sure everything's running on schedule. I've also been told I will be handling sales within a few months. \n\nBUT, like I said the pay is shit and the more I work here, the less I feel like this position has anything to do with engineering. Even with the promotions, I don't think my pay will reach what entry level engineers receive. So, my dilemma is this: I want to be paid like an engineer, but I feel that this company is giving me experience most engineers would never have the opportunity to get so easily (this is literally my first job). I am continuing to pursue other jobs (although less aggressively and more selectively), but I wonder if this is something I should stick with. Could I get back in the engineering world after I get some cool experience with this company? Am I stuck on this small company, non-engineer career path if I stay? \n\nIf the money was right, I would love to stay here -- I think I'm learning a heck of a lot and my job sounds way more interesting than my corporate engineer friends' jobs. But the pay just doesn't compare and I don't want to give up on my engineering. Maybe I'm misinterpreting what real engineers even do and I can still be considered one.

{"prompt":"I'm a M\/25 and I've always dated my whole life. I don't have a problem meeting people in the slightest. I've had my fair share of casual dating, one night stands, long term relationships and have even been in love. \n\nMy main issue right now is this and I will paraphrase this: On a business trip I met an amazing girl. We went on a few dates and then I went home. However, we stayed in constant contact. I went back on business only this time we spent the night together, had super passionate sex and made our feelings for each other known. However, we both agreed a NY to TX relationship wasn't in our best interest. This girl is perfect for me. We get along and have a great friendship.\n\nHowever, now I am dating a girl and although she is also great...falls extremely short in comparison.

{"prompt":"My sister and I are a few years apart and in our 30s. I am the youngest, she is the oldest. I am trying to figure out the best way to be supportive of her as she is working through her marriage problems. She randomly said she was going to visit for a few days, which caught me off guard. Unfortunately I made the mistake of telling her that I already had plans. I didn't realize until a little later that maybe she was reaching out because she needed to get out of the house and take some time away from her spouse.\n  \nShe recently lost her job a few months ago and is stuck at home in a suburb area. They only have one car (they used to commute together) so I can only imagine how hard it is for her right now to be going through difficulties and stuck at home all day.  \n  \nShe is not the type to reach out to me for help, especially with me being the younger sibling, so I feel bad that I missed out on this opportunity to show her support. I tried to tell her she was welcome to spend some time with me but it might have come across as being too charity-like. I honestly don't know.

{"prompt":"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year now. She explains to me that we have the most incredible sex she has ever had. She loves it so much that she wants to make a pornographic film starring us so that she can masturbate to it when I am out of town. She also wants to make a film so that I do not watch porn as much (meaning that she is ok with making multiple films and doing the crazy stuff). My question to you reddit is, what is the best way of filming yourself having sex? \nI am 100% ok with making the video, but I want it to actually turn out watchable. During sex, we switch positions fairly often. Often times, we move from the bed to the floor or to the desk or to my love seat. Sometimes we incorporate handcuffs and other toys. She likes to be bent over my bedside and she loves to 69. She also loves to cowgirl, blow me, and sometimes sit on my face, so I would think it would not be a great idea to leave my computer's camera on a desk and get up every 10 minutes to adjust the camera angle. I feel like this plan also will not show enough detail if the camera is 10 feet away on my desk. Another idea was to hold the camera and make it more of a POV style, but she says that she wants to see both of our bodies during sex (which i agree with). I want to be able to see her entire body bent over my bed and not just a shaky shot of her ass. I was going to hold the camera for sure while she was blowing me at the end though. Possibly also when she would be reverse cowgirl-ing me. The final idea thrown around was to get a third party to actually film us. She is uncomfortable with the idea of having another individual there, but I am comfortable with the idea only as an absolute last resort. I have been given a gift from god reddit. My girlfriend is willing to do the crazy stuff AND film it. I do not want to mess this up. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

During sex, we switch positions fairly often. Often times, we move from the bed to the floor or to the desk or to my love seat. Sometimes we incorporate handcuffs and other toys. She likes to be bent over my bedside and she loves to 69. She also loves to cowgirl, blow me, and sometimes sit on my face, so I would think it would not be a great idea to leave my computer's camera on a desk and get up every 10 minutes to adjust the camera angle. I feel like this plan also will not show enough detail if the camera is 10 feet away on my desk. Another idea was to hold the camera and make it more of a POV style, but she says that she wants to see both of our bodies during sex (which i agree with). I want to be able to see her entire body bent over my bed and not just a shaky shot of her ass. I was going to hold the camera for sure while she was blowing me at the end though. Possibly also when she would be reverse cowgirl-ing me. The final idea thrown around was to get a third party to actually film us. She is uncomfortable with the idea of having another individual there, but I am comfortable with the idea only as an absolute last resort. I have been given a gift from god reddit. My girlfriend is willing to do the crazy stuff AND film it. I do not want to mess this up. Any advice is greatly appreciated. If it turns out well, maybe I will show some of the commenters :)","chosen":"Need help making a porno of my girlfriend and I having sex.","rejected":"Girlfriend wants to make a porno with me and my boyfriend.

{"prompt":"My SO and I have been dating for several months, and I met his parents and siblings about a month ago, and he met my parents as well. Last weekend my SO and I got kinda drunk and talked honestly about our families' impressions of each other. He said that his parents thought I was nice\/polite and that they want to spend more time with me, and that his youngest siblings (who are in elementary school) think I'm fun. \n\nHowever, he said that his 19 year old sister thinks that I don't like her. Of course that's completely ridiculous, as I can't not like someone who I have barely talked to. Also, if she's anything like my boyfriend, I'll definitely like her. When I met her, we were at her parents' house and she seemed kinda busy with homework, so I said hi to her, had a short conversation about Christmas plans, then I left her alone. \n\nI would think that of all the people in his family, his sister who's closest to me in age would be the easiest to get along with, rather than his parents or his much younger siblings. I asked my boyfriend why she thinks I don't like her, and he seemed as confused as I was. This is especially weird to me, as people who I've just met usually think I'm really nice. Since I really like my SO a lot and plan on being with him for a long time, it really matters to me that his family likes me.\n\nSince we live like 2 hours from his parents, I don't see the family that often, so I don't have any immediate opportunity to be super nice to her.

We both live in the same area, so I said lets go out to dinner sometime whenever she is back in the area.  She said sure, and we went our separate ways.

{"prompt":"Long Post.\n\nHey relationship_advice I need your opinion on a situation that looks complicated too me.  \n\nBack Story:\n\nI met this girl in college we were partners for a project in class, we got along great, she was cute but of course she had a boyfriend.  We both live in the same area, so I said lets go out to dinner sometime whenever she is back in the area.  She said sure, and we went our separate ways.  I honestly never thought I would see her again and didn't even think about it.\n\nFast forward one year later, all of a sudden I get a text saying, \"Hey, Thursday dinner?  It's been to long.\"  We ended up meeting for dinner and it went pretty well from my perspective.  She mentioned her boyfriend briefly and how she is struggling with the fact the he lives 4 hours away.  But most of the conversation we talked about our jobs and I joked about stuff and made her laugh, \"Ha ha, you're so funny.\"  We talked about going out on the town sometime and going hiking during the weekend, but her boyfriend was coming up to see her.  As we were about to leave I said we should have dinner again, and she immediately setup another time next week.\n\nOver the weekend, that her boyfriend was over, she sent me a text at 11PM with just the name of a bar.  I wanted to go meet up but I was an hour away, hanging with my buddies and by the time I drove back to my apartment changed and went out it would have been 1AM, so I texted her back telling her this and haven't heard anything since then.\n\nSo am I reading into things?  If she didn't have a boyfriend, I am pretty sure the signs are telling me she is interested in me, but the fact that she does kinda complicates things.  Am I friend zoned or should I go for it.  Right now I am thinking just F$#$ it and go for it, but maybe you can provide some insight in anything I might have missed.

{"prompt":"Hey Reddit,\nSo about a year and a half ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 2+ years. It was my first real relationship and the first time I ever felt truly in love with someone. The relationship was in no way perfect, in fact it was barely holding together which is why I decided to end it. \nSmall backstory on the relationship,\n-For the entirety of our relationship her parents didn't know about me.\n-She lived with her parents.\n-She was afraid they'd deny her the right to see me if they knew about us.\n-She basically provided for her parents (paid mortgage, etc)\n-I put up with this because I was naive and stupid.\n\nAfter we broke up I was super duper depressed. But I didn't try to get us back together because I still didn't think things could work the way they were. \n\nMy problem is that a year and a half later, I can't seem to get her out of my mind. I haven't talked to her in a year, but still know things about her from time to time because the internet is stupid and it's too god damn easy to find things out. I'm getting better about staying away though.\n\nI still think about her almost every day. When I think about what I want in a relationship, all I picture is her. When I think about wanting to call or text someone to excitedly talk about some new thing I've found out or whatever I think of her. Her phone number is burned forever into my memory because I made myself memorize it when we were together in case of emergencies. (Fun fact, I was waaaaaay more into the relationship than she was apparently).\nI've had two short term relationships since we've broken up. Each one has only lasted a couple months. While they help in easing my mind away from the Ex I can't help comparing those relationships to the big one and finding the small ones faulting.\n\nSo please, any help in getting rid of thoughts about her? Meditation? Lobotomy? Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind machine?\n\nThanks.","chosen":"I can't get over my ex, and I'm starting to see her every day.

Then in late January she somehow remembered that she had drunk sex with someone named Dylan (who is a different from other person she was \"seeing\"). After I found this out I was really upset and somewhat heartbroken. I really wished that she had lost it to me, but I just thought to myself that it is okay because I'm the only one that she will have sex with from now on.

{"prompt":"I am a divorced man of 40, not bad looking and in the 3 years since I split from my ex-wife I have met dozens of women.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, a barmaid in a local pub told me her friend liked me, we exchanged numbers and arranged to go on a date. I could not really remember what she looked like as I had drank quite a lot. I met her the following week and was absolutely blown away by how attractive she was. The date went well and she came back to mine, and we stayed up chatting until the early hours.\n\nI really liked her and we continued to go on dates, or she would come around and we would drink wine, listening music, chat, and have sex.\n\nWe both had said that we don't do relationships; she had an ex-boyfriend she had to see as a business partner, but he would stay at hers' as he lives in a different city. I was dating several other woman at the same time and was open about it with my partner.\n\nBut as time went on I started to fall in love with her and let my emotions rule my mind. I was starting to get jealous about her ex and would sleep with other girls just to make myself feel better.\n\nWe had a fall out on Thursday, so I slept with another girl on Friday night, I sent my partner flowers on Saturday morning and spent all day drinking as I was love sick. She rang and thanked me for the flowers and came to the pub to meet me. We had a couple of drinks and went home for some wine.

{"prompt":"I created this post, and have read through a lot of the comments saying that nuclear power is bad, and most of the reasons why are simply ignorance.\nLet me stress this here, THE PROBLEM IS NOT WITH NUCLEAR POWER, its with the old reactors we are using.\nFor instance, Thorium reactors can't meltdown, can't produce nuclear weapons, they produce power much more cheaply and efficiently than conventional uranium power plants. Thorium is so common that it is an annoyance when digging for more valuable metals. The only reason the world went with uranium instead of thorium is because we all wanted to get nuclear weapons from this too. We knew about this shit in the 1950's for fuck's sake.\nSO DON'T BLAME NUCLEAR POWER, blame your fucktarded governments.\n\nAlso, Bill Gates recently did a TED talk where he described a process that he had simulated which would allow us to react uranium 235, and other waste elements from uranium power plants. Essentially, a way to turn all the radioactive waste that we thought was going to fuck our planet into energy. RIGHT NOW, we have enough nuclear waste to power the Earth for 1000 YEARS.\n\nSo don't get me wrong, I think that the nuclear power plants we have now do have lots of problem, but don't think that that's the case with ALL nuclear power. It is the safest, and most powerful energy source we've created. Coal plants actually put more radioactive elements into the atmosphere. We could fly a fucking plane into a power plant, and it would be fine. \n\nAnd, also, you know, it kinda helps if we don't build these power plants in places where your more or less guaranteed a massive disaster at some point. Just don't be fucking stupid.","chosen":"It's not the nuclear power that's the problem, its our governments.","rejected":"Don't blame nuclear power, its the governments who are fucking stupid."}

{"prompt":"Alright so I've been dating this girl for two weeks, although I've been courting her for at least a month and a half. I know she's younger than me. (consent age in Florida, yadayada, we're in highschool don't freak out) She's really cool and we have a lot of interests in common, and her parents really like me. \n\nSo anyway, today my dad and I had a short conversation about her parents. Come to find out he was worried about her parents liking me, because he'd had a similar situation with my older brother and his first wife. \n\nMy brother's girlfriend's parents always wanted to drive the two of them around and be with them, just like my girlfriend's parents do.\nFor example, my girlfriend had a band competition she needed to go to. I drove to her house and her parents took me to it. They're always inviting me to do things with them through her just like my brother's in laws did. As a guy with no income at the moment (football season, can't get a job) this seemed great to me to save gas and because her parents are legitimately nice people.\n\nThe problem with my brother came when they got married, and her parents still wanted to drive them around and tried to control their lives and tell him what to do. \n\nThis really scared me. I am just exactly the kind of subservient \"nice guy\" that a controlling parent would want for their daughter. I don't want to be stuck in that sort of trap somewhere down the line even if it is a lesser trap just in our current relationship, but I also don't want to alienate her parents if it turns out they are just legitimately nice people. I have not spoken on these feelings with anyone yet.\n\nHow can I find out if her parents want to manipulate me? I've only been out with her once alone, in all the month and a half I've been courting her.

{"prompt":"Hey all, so over the past year or so I have been actively losing weight by changing my diet. I'm a 5'9 male that started at 275 lbs and was cutting and counting calories, losing weight at a solid pace. I have switched up my calorie intake a few times throughout, giving myself a lot of calories in the beginning to start slow but eventually was cutting very hard. I was eating around 1200-1300 calories a day and exercising a few times a week. That went on for a couple months but I realized that while I was losing the weight I wasn't feeling that great and that maybe I was doing more harm than good and decided I needed to eat more.  I have been sitting at around 1500 calories a day for the past couple months with exercise around 4 times a week (mostly cardio) and its been solid. I am down to around 187 lbs and am in some of the best shape I have been in years. Also a lot of people have been giving me compliments and its been nice. That being said, I still want to lose another 15 or so pounds but have started to notice my stomach is really flabby and squishy and have noticeable stretch marks. I have started to weight lift heavy and want to get my last weight lost but also look better aesthetically and not just on the scale. was wondering if I should maybe slow my weight loss to a pound a week so I can keep some of the muscle I have and possibly help out with the skin on my stomach. Was curious if anybody had any similar feelings after losing a lot of weight. Thanks.","chosen":"Lost 85 lbs in just over a year, stomach is flabby and squishy with some quality stretch marks. Started lifting heavy weight, should I up my calories and slow the weight loss?","rejected":"I'm losing weight but I am still not feeling great and I want to not have to see those stretch marks, is that a good idea?"}

{"prompt":"Hi Wedditors! I just got married on Saturday. :) I worked with the most amazing florist. The wedding was in Carmel, CA. However, I was in school the last four years and had to plan nearly everything from Scotland. My husband lived 5 hours south of the florist and didn't know enough about flowers to communicate my ideas to her.  She and I played email tag for 4 months before we could finally meet up, which was 4 weeks before the wedding. I never sent her a deposit before this date, she didn't know any of my ideas, colours, etc. She kept the date open for me and when we discussed everything to get a quote she said she had no minimums. I was a bit stressed out trying to sort flowers out so soon to the wedding, but she has the most amazing personality and calmed me down within seconds. We took a few things off the invoice that weren't very expensive, but we had decided not to do them. I know I did not pay for them, but she had still made the boutonnieres. I called her in confusion (I didn't know what they were or what for) since she beat me to the venue by a full hour and was already at the reception. I said I would double check the invoice and send her a check, but she only said, \"Don't worry about it. Merry Christmas.\" The bouquets and centrepieces were gorgeous. Even without the extra items we didn't pay for I still want to send her a tip, but I doubt she'll cash a check and I don't want to post cash. Any suggestions?

We don't care about each other's flaws, deal with each other's bullshit, have identical sex drives, and are equally silly and lazy.

Maybe that's the wrong term since infatuation might be sexual? I know nothing will further blossom out this admiration, but that doesn't mean I should let it continue until we both go away. I just don't want to be infatuated with her . Idk if you can help me or not or this was all pointless.","chosen":"I'm infatuated with other girl. I have no interest in her romantically.

{"prompt":"Duration of entire relationship: 2 years. \n\nI ended up in a weird and almost fucked up relationship. Basically this girl and I were friends and her boyfriend left to Japan for a semester as a study abroad deal for his photography. What's interesting is that he gave her free reign to hook up with me, and so we did. It got to the point that I realized that I was probably hooked, and it looks like she was too. The boyfriend and her have been having nasty arguments and fights even before Japan. They were fighting in almost every conversation they had, I took nobodies side. I didn't even try to make them break apart, I think it's because I adore the guy as well. He's an awesome kid. It was too late though because I was in love with this girl.

I let them handle it. On the contrary I even gave advice to patch things up between them because I was in a similar situation. Instead she fell in love with me too. I am positive she did.\nSo it all comes down to: He's back from Japan and I just gave her back to him, without a fight. I figured he's her real boyfriend and I would be a traitor to take her away from him. I can't backstab such a good friend. So I went home. I collapsed and just wept and wept for hours. I just couldn't stop. I still can't stop. I don't want to talk with either of them because I know I will not be logical or coherent. I'm positive if I saw them together I would break down and just bawl my eyes out on the spot.\n\nWhat do I do? Nothing is consoling me, my hobbies, my goals, dreams, everything just seems insignificant.
