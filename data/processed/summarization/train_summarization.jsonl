This guy [22\/M] and I started flirting a bit last week, just went on a unofficial double date tonight. He was... Amazing. Smart, sweet, cute, seemed very into me. We could have kept talking for hours it felt like. Before we started the date I was super nervous that this would just hurt, that I wasn't ready, that I wouldn't like him or he wouldn't like me. That was all entirely gone by the end of the night, and I was left with this feeling that I would be okay getting hurt again because the potential relationship that this could become would be worth it. \n\nI leave for a month on August 2, so about a week and a half away.

{"prompt":"I have been employed at my first job as a sales associate for a local family business chain for 6 months.

However I just went into the office where I got the job and my (soon to be) boss hadn't realized that I have student loans not grants and they only hire people who have grants.

They seem to be working things out, and she has cut off communication with the \"other guy.\"\n\nHowever, I know she did not tell her boyfriend ALL of the truth, and he may have no idea that she actually slept with this other person. I find her lack of telling him the complete truth to show that it's possible that she never will tell him. I consider them both friends, though I haven't known them very long. I've actually known her longer than he, but duration of friendship isn't always testament to how strong a bond is. I think he is a great guy, and the longer it takes her to tell him, the more it will hurt him and I don't like to see my friends hurt.\n\nIt seems like the girl wants to just keep lying because she can continue her relationship.

I ended up just talking for an hour during that date and it went pretty well.\nDuring Valentine's day, I sent her a rose to her dorm room. However, I expected a thank you or a text or something, so I automatically assumed that she wasn't interested in me anymore after the date.\nHowever, a few days afterwards, what happened was one of my friends went out on a group dinner with her and her friends and directly asked her if she liked me.

{"prompt":"I'm seventeen years old. I'm a senior in high school. I live in a very close knit town where I go to parties with kids in 10th grade and kids who are seniors in college. We've all known each other forever; it's not weird. Anyway..\n\nA month or so ago I went to a party with a few friends at one of their older brother's houses. We were all hanging out having a good time when a guy who I knew casually walked up to me. We started talking, and before we knew it, we had been chatting it up for nearly an hour and a half. We exchanged numbers and continued to talk. Now, we text each other constantly, and I can't get him out of my head. It amazes me how much we have in common, and it's so easy for him to put a smile on my face. Last weekend, I gave him a ride home from a get together, and while we were sitting in front of his house, he looked at me and said \"This is bad..\" I questioned his statement, and he told me he's falling for me. He told me that he wants to start spending more time with me, and that he doesn't want me to think he's trying anything scummy. (I'm assuming this was to reassure me because he's a notorious lady's man, and is known to get over on girls pretty easily) But, we've been talking for about a month and a half, and we haven't hooked up at all. He seems like an honest and genuine person, and it's hard for me to imagine where all the rumors about him have come from. Here's the most difficult part... he's twenty-two. From what I can tell, he's more mature and more down to earth than most of the guys my age, and the only downfall is the five year gap.. If he was really just trying to get in my pants, why would he have waited this long? He's incredibly attractive and could easily have any girl he wanted, but instead he's been sticking around.\n\nSo Reddit, am I being stupid by even thinking about pursuing this? Is this guy just taking advantage of a naive 17 year old with his looks and charm, or do you think he's really into me?","chosen":"Met a guy on a party, talked for nearly an hour and a half, no sex, no hook up, still can't get him out of my head.","rejected":"I'm 17, lately I've been talking to a 22 y\/o.

{"prompt":"Hi Reddit,\n\nThis is my first post on reddit ever, so please excuse me if I'm not doing this correctly.\n\nI met a very nice girl on plenty of fish about 4 months ago. We get a long great and we have both developed feelings for each other. We spend everyday with each other and were both very happy and content with the way things are going. I haven't been in many relationships before and my last one was a long distance relationship which lasted about 6 years so the dynamics of seeing someone on a consistent basis is very new to me.\n\nDuring the first month of my new relationship we abstained from actual sex, we did however mess around and fore play with in the first 2 weeks of being together. After about a month into this relationship we started to have actual sex on a consistent and regular basis, (4-5 times a week). This has been the same up until about 2 weeks ago.\n\nI noticed she seems to not want it as much now, isn't as intimate with me and doesn't seem as interested. I asked her about this and she says she wants sex less for the build up for when we do have it. She assures me this is the only reason why we are having sex less, however she has a high sex drive, but wants to abstain.\n\nSo I'm left a little confused, she has a high sex drive, we had a lot of good sex in the beginning however that has dropped off and now she wants to wait 2-3 days per \"session\" per say. \n\nThe whole scenario is making me slightly insecure because it happened all of a sudden, or seemed too. \n\nWhat I'm trying to ask is - is this a normal thing for a relationship with the information I posted above? I'm posting due to my lack of experience with regular, consistent relationships in terms of sex.

I told Anna that I was hanging out with Karen, but not specifically what we were doing, and I've elected to not tell Karen about Anna at all, as it's supremely obvious that she wants nothing more than a FWB setup.

I'm not sure if it was technically broken, but it became swollen and slightly crooked. I visited an ENT in a timely manner and made an another appointment with that doctor to have my nose reset. However, I never actually went through with the procedure because of insurance issues. (My car and medical insurers both stated that it was the others' responsibility.)\n\nNow, my nose still remains slightly crooked. I've also been having breathing issues and recurrent nosebleeds since the injury.

Correcting the breathing issues are my priority, but I'd also like to correct the slight crookedness if possible.

While living in Ireland and attending an Irish secondary school, there is no bigger stigma than being someone who is 'a frigdit' i.e someone who has never kissed (or in ireland, 'shifted') someone. After being very socially awkward, lacking in confidence and being self-conscious, it is only now at age 16 that I'm beginning to come out of my shell and actually talk to girls. After asking a few girls whom I liked over the past few months for, 'the shift', I have been met with rejection each time. Keeping \"beggars can't be choosers\" in mind, I decided to lower my standards a bit to a girl that I'm almost certain I have a chance with, however do not really have feelings for. So after the past week of chatting to her, trying to work something out, I have been thinking, what do I do afterwards?

His interactions with her were very intimate; this led to jealousy on my behalf, and amongst a list of other things, fueled the break-up - as I wasn't confident in \"loving myself enough for him to love me.\" In the meantime, this girl has become one of my closest friends, rivaling that of my own sister. \n\nFast forward three months, and I find that our mutual housing agreements have been aborted, through the too-loud mentioning through a closed door.  They thought I wasn't home, and went on to discuss their plans to move in together with the rest of my roommates present (one is getting married, the other is studying abroad.)  \n\nIt seems that everyone knew except for me, and I've never felt so betrayed by the people that I called my \"family,\" several hundred miles from home.\n\nHow to cope with these feelings of isolation, lack of belonging, and betrayal?","chosen":"Ex-boyfriend (25m) and mutual roommate (22f) have made plans to move in together without me (24f), leaving me (24f) to look for my own place.

I have known him a long time, I know when he is lying, and the \"new office girl\" is making him a fibber. \n\nHere are my concerns;\n\n1) When he is more involved with someone at work than he should be he is more prone to bringing up that person over and over again in conversation, the new girl has been brought up A LOT recently.\n\n2) He will say rude things about the women in his office, I think in an attempt to make me think he's not interested, but this is how I know who the attractive girls at his job are. For example, the new girl has been called \"gap tooth\" even though I have seen her facebook and I know that yes, she does have a gap in her teeth, but the rest of her is adorable. So freaking lame of him.\n\n3) He will suddenly get VERY enthusiastic about having sex. Last week he was all about my boobs suddenly. I have good sized breasts but they are mostly ignored as he is an ass man. New girl happens to have large breasts as well, and I dont think it's a coincidence  that this girl with big boobs starts working there and all of sudden my husband is all about my breasts.\n\nAll of this kind of crap annoys me to no end, I feel like when he is having sex with me, he is probably thinking about her, and that makes me want to punch him. So, my question is this...When men have sex with their wife, are they usually thinking about someone else? I mean, how much of this nonsense should I put up with? I dont think he would straight up cheat on me, but the thought of him thinking about her while having sex with me just makes me angry, but I don't know if it should make me angry or if hes just being a guy.

We're getting to the point that surgery might be on the horizon. *This is serious business.* Migraines can sometimes trigger strokes.

{"prompt":"Be sure to explain in detail with line breaks.\n\nOk, I will try to make this as short as possible.  Basically last fall, my friend an I started a more intimate relationship.  It was purely physical nothing serious.  I had given up on wanting a relationship years ago.  But I eventually began having feelings for him.  Before I can say anything, everything just stops and it doesn't get resolved\n\nIn January, I still had unresolved feelings for him that I wanted to get some closure.  So I decide to talk to him about it.  Unfortuantly, that day he hurt himself and instead of talking we spend the day at the hospital.\n\nFast forward, to last week.   He and I have texted back and forth a few times, but really havn't seen each other.  Now I have decided that I finally want to start dating again;  but I was afraid now that he's getting better he may want to start hanging out again, and it may cause me problems with dating other guys. \n\nSo I ask him if we can get together because I need to talk to him.  We do and I tell him I explain everything to him, and tell him that it may be best if we don't talk for a while.  Just so I get over my feelings for him.   He said he understood, but I was unsure ifhe really did.  I thought this would bring closure, but I was wrong.  What I really needed was for him to basically reject me so I would know nothing could ever happen between us.  \n\nSo last night I'm drinking with some friends, and drunk me decides to text him to get that rejection.  Literally, I asked him to just reject me so I could get on with my life.\n\nHe didn't respond, thankfully.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I feel bad for sending it; even though it was what I wanted to say.  I'm not sure if I should apologize and explain.

I actually met her for 30 seconds before they moved on and later I messaged her, got her number yada yada and now we text and snapchat on a semi regular basis.\n\nI'm really confused because I've asked her on a breakfast date where she initially said yes, only to cancel later saying she had shit to do with her mom without making alternative arrangements. When we text, there's times where she just stops replying completely but then sends me snapchats the next day. When we first talked, she complained about her ex a lot when they dated back in February to the point where I had to confront her about me not being her emotional tampon and how I didn't want her to get too comfortable with me despite not knowing each other pretty much. At that point my motivation was pretty low, and I ceased to text her for a month.\n\nRecently after a month of not texting, she texted me first saying hey and asking me how I was doing and we talked a bit about how we were preparing for school. She actually explicitly asked me that we should both get a coffee together at school and I expedited it by suggesting that we should go to our university's kickoff game. She said yes and that it'd be a new thing for her to try but later that night, she said she couldn't go because she had to work an on call shift. (She's a high school tutor so it's busy season now). I totally understood and wasn't blown off by her cancelling, but by the fact that she never makes alternative arrangements and therefore leaves us in a limbo again.\n\nSince I've known her for 30 seconds in person, I'm not emotionally attached, but I would like to give this girl a genuine shot IRL before writing it off and moving on. Should I cut my losses, tell her I'm not content with our interactions being limited to social media or wait for her to start something? Or any other suggestions?

{"prompt":"Tonight I'm attending a Star Wars themed Christmas party, so I thought I'd dress up a little. My initial idea was to wear a cardboard box and call myself an \"ammunition droid\", but my dad threw out all of our larger boxes that I could have made into an outfit. So, Plan B was to dress in a bathrobe and be a low-budget Jedi. After rummaging around my room for some other Jedi-ish looking clothes, I realized I'd need a lightsaber. No problem, all my kid's toys and stuff are stored away in the garage...I couldn't throw out my prized plastic lightsabers I used all the time, right? During my search through the garage, I came across a bin on a high shelf labeled, \"<Poisonbullet9>'s TOYS\". Score! I lifted the bin from its shelf and had a look. Inside were a bunch of boxes that I couldn't remember ever seeing, and where were all my old footballs, army men, and star wars toys?

I think this is because I'm very quiet and this doesn't translate well into online communication, or something, who knows...\n\nAnyways, there's a girl I really like; her family is friends with my family and we somewhat recently got back into contact with them, and we all get along well, her, her younger brother, my younger sister, and I.  The problem is she goes to school pretty far away; about a four hour trip from where I live.  But I really, really like her, and I can't stop thinking about her.\n\nAnother problem is that she is also very shy, and I tried messaging her awhile ago (about 7 or 8 months ago) and it went back and forth a bit, before fizzling out.  \n\nBasically, I am wondering if any of you think it's worth me trying to get to know her better or even telling her that I really like her, and if you might have any tips on how I might go about doing so.\n\nAlso, as for whether or not she might feel the same way about me, I really can't tell.  She is very friendly towards me, she laughs when I try to be funny, and we can talk somewhat, even with being shy, but I really cannot tell if she likes me or not.  We make a fair bit of eye contact when we talk and stuff, though I try to do that with most people.  The only thing I can go off is that when we've left their family the last two times, it's seemed that she's made a (perhaps very slight) effort to say more of a goodbye to me, but that could be in my head, and also I saw her glance at me once (reading that back now sounds totally desperate but I'll leave it in there).\n\nAnyways, hope someone (or multiple someones) might have some advice \/ tips \/ something to help me out.

Things began to heat up between us, with both of us lamenting our relationship status and how we felt lonely and horny. As we became closer, we started realizing that we both really identified with each other and even made frequent jokes about how we are \"exactly the same person\", because our life situations and personalities are so similar and mesh so well with each other. This culminated about two weeks ago, when we both ended up admitting to each other than we wouldn't mind a purely sexual relationship between the two of us since we were both so horny.\n\nNow I don't know where we stand. I don't know how I feel about her--I've never really even been in a real relationship in my life. I'm attracted to her, and I care about her a lot--but I'm not sure where the line is drawn from a FWB situation with a close friend to a relationship. I know she's also confused about her feelings about me, and we haven't even had full on sex with each other yet (although we certainly have been very frisky and had some enjoyable sexual encounters with each other). \n\nWhat makes a \"relationship\" exactly?

It made me feel terrible, and I cleaned up my act. I didn't look at other women, I didn't speak with other women, and I always did my best to be there for her when I could. It's hard to do this for me, because I'm in a fraternity here at my college, and social presence is particularly important in our organization; especially with the ladies.\n\nSo this past weekend, she calls me Sunday morning and tells me she went out with some friends, got drunk, and hooked up with someone.

I slept on the couch, literally for 3 years until we moved to a new house and I got my own room in the basement.\n\nFor 3 years after my son was born we fought almost daily.

However, I don't like criticizing him because he normally tries really hard, his self-esteem is on the lower side, and this is his first time. I really like him and I hate not talking to him; I just have never felt so alone in a relationship before. \n\nHe's not like any other guy I've dated before. I have no idea how to handle the quiet and inexperienced type, and for some reason his feelings seem that much more delicate. Any advice is highly appreciated.","chosen":"Boyfriend not talking to me and I don't know how to handle it.","rejected":"My bf doesn't talk to me for the first 2-3 weeks of a 3 month relationship and I don't know what to do, or how to handle the situation."}
{"prompt":"I've been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for 14 months. She wanted a hiatus to focus on school, she felt a lot of pressure from our relationship, and she needed to figure things out. I messaged her again last week, and told her I still missed her. We had our first conversation in 8 months and kind of caught up with what's been going on in each others lives.\n\nI interpreted this as she was ready to restart our relationship, but she stopped talking to me after two days. She hasn't messaged me since Thursday and I've messaged her every day since then. Idk why she's not responding to my messages. Maybe she's just not in the mood to talk, maybe she isn't ready to restart out relationship yet, maybe she was just busy with other stuff, maybe she's stressed out because she's starting school and doesn't want to handle our relationship on top of that, or maybe she doesn't love me anymore.\n\nI really don't know how to handle the situation. Should I ask her why she's not talking to me? Would that approach be too aggressive\/controlling (I want you to talk to me right now and if you don't I'll be upset kind of thing)? Should I confront her about it? If so how? Should I stop messaging her or would that make me seem disinterested?\n\nAlso just a side note. I know most suggestions on here are to break up with the person, but I'm not breaking up with her so if that's your suggestion don't bother.\n\nThanks for reading!

I was told this by several people who didn't like her bitching about this behind my back, and wanted me to know what she'd been saying. Anyway, I wasn't very offended but I was pretty annoyed at the ignorance and the idea of her spreading this rumour that I liked her, when I had a gf. For the next two years I sat next to her at every possible opportunity, including the bus home (This was not my bus, but I always got it with a friend after school so we could hang out for a bit.

I started my full-time career 3 years ago back in 2012 and worked at this Korean music management company for two years. I loved 70% of my job and I hated the rest of the 30% which involved a lot of bs and politics within the company that really overtook the good sides of the job. I was also being fed up with Kpop scenes so I ended up quitting the job early 2014.\n\nI left Korea right after I quit to try something else. I wasn't doing too well but I definitely enjoyed my time learning and seeing new things in music scenes of N. America.

For all last night, all I could think about was, \"oh god I hope she's not doing anything with anybody\"\/\"Maybe she didn't come home because she went home with someone else\"\/\"God damn it I just want her to be home so I know she's not doing anything\" and other things like that. But I wouldn't let myself text or call her to find out what she was doing because I didn't want to impede on her \"space.\" This was almost torture and to put myself through that for anything longer than last night would be like self inflicted wounds. So when I awoke I saw baonnnnnnnnn's comment about just letting go and becoming Doc Chubs 2.0, this was what really snapped for me. \n\nSo in conclusion, I have awoken today, I went for a run, did some other work out stuff (which, is unheard of for my fat lazy ass) and after my shower I started packing all of my stuff. I have in the past hour gotten nearly everything of mine out of the apartment and in my car ready to move. I plan on leaving on Sunday still because I have work soon and don't have the time to fully move out. However, once I am out I plan on not talking to her at all for at least a month, unless she contacts me which of course I will be civil and would accept nothing more than a plutonic friendship!\n\nSo I would like to thank everyone who commented, it really did help snap me out of my denial or shock or whatever I was in.

I didn't come to be with her because of sex, but i am a guy and i do enjoy sex and it we got to a point where it was just once a week and to be honest i could live with that because there is a lot more to relationships than just sex, but the once a week thing only happens when we have discussion after discussion on why i want to have sex again.\n\nIt got to a point where i really felt detached because i feel like i had to beg for sex and so i set out looking for a solution, after reading reddit and a few websites i saw that the PILL could cause negative libido and a few woman had described that sex felt like a job they only did because their SO asked them to.\n\nWell now we get to the problem, my gf is a stubborn little girl and its really hard to change her mind once shes set on something and in my haste i didn't think the problem through and i made a deal with the devil, i ran to her saying that i would give up sex for two months if she gave up the pill for two months, to be honest i figured she would say no and we would negotiate and then figure something out.. but alas she said yes and thus today she skipped her pill and begins my two months of non sexual adventures.\n\nAnything i can do to salvage this deal and put me back in the sexual spotlight ? or do i have to just suck it up and deal with the next two months.","chosen":"i asked her to stop taking the pill for 2 months and i would stop having sex with her for 2 months she agreed, i wanna renegotiate xD","rejected":"asked for sex for two months, girlfriend said yes, now she's skipping her pill"}

A couple of details seemed odd to me, though - a central location was a club named \"Ragnarok.\" I realized I knew the word but not its story, and looked it up online. And read a bit more of Norse myth. And a bit more.\n\nThen I went back to try the game again. The cop who gets killed early on, starting the plot - name of Balder. Cold winter, only getting colder. \"Starting to sound exactly like the myth of Ragnarok. Neat!\" The mysterious old man is named Woden, an alternate reading of Odin? The evil superdrug is named Valkyr, now we're getting a little heavy-handed. But still neat.\n\nThen the second game came out. I fully expected the writers to let the Ragnarok theme drop a little, but was looking forward to *Shootmans 2: Fly Slower*. The closing credits to the game was a song, \"Late Goodbye\" by Poets of the Fall. I didn't listen to much music except as a background, but I liked it. First single I bought, and they're now my favorite band.\n\nThen I went back to try the game again. It pops up all through the game, I noticed - some random janitor is blaring it over his headphones. One gangster plays it on the piano of an apartment they'd just massacred. The love interest sings it - *badly* - in the shower. I felt it worked perfectly - Our hero was just getting over the loss of his wife and kid, just starting to reconnect with another person, and hating himself for it.

Unfortunately he thinks we REALLY did.......\n\nAnyways, I'm not sure how much information I have to give him when explaining why I don't want to see him anymore, so this is one question I have.\n\nMy main question is HOW? He's ALWAYS texting me, and we don't spend any time talking on the phone or anything, so it might be weird to call. But it doesn't seem necessary to tell him in person or anything. Is it completely ridiculous for people our age to say \"no thanks\" to future dates via text? Obviously calling is a lot more stressful, but if it's the right thing to do, I will.","chosen":"boy asks me out, I go on two dates, afterwards he keeps texting\/calling me, but I don't want to see him. how do I tell him this?","rejected":"How do I let him know I am no longer interested in seeing him or getting involved with him?

I also explained that I appreciated his passion, but I just don't like to take anything too seriously, and I'm really bad with dealing with it when people are sensitive about something, since I don't really feel that strongly about things like that. I told him I really hate hurting people's feelings, and he said I could use some more tact.\n\nLater on, I told him I felt weird about everything, though I said it's kinda my fault. He was nice and said it was kinda his fault too.

{"prompt":"Hi\n\nI've been with my gf for just under 2 years. Generally, we get along quite well.\n\nWe moved in together about 11 months ago. At the time she had no one else to move in with and I felt kind of pressured without her actually asking and I ended up asking her to move in with me. I also got the impression she was doing it because some of her friends were moving in with their partners and so forth, I did bring this up at the time. When we were discussing moving in together I raised the issue that she does not earn much money and has a lot of credit card debt and a car loan, so I did not want her relying on me for money.\n\nSince we've moved in we generally we get along well, not much fighting. There have been a few issues, mainly surrounding \"give and take\" e.g. I felt like I was supporting her a lot and she did very little for me in return. I feel like the situation has improved somewhat but still not quite where I'd like it to be.\n\nI've never been quite sure whether I'd like to be with this girl forever, there are a few things I'm not sure about. I don't know whether I'm being nit-picky or whether I should be genuinely concerned e.g. she seems very quick to judge some people, quite anti-intellectual at times and very immature with money.\n\nIn addition to all that, I don't know what I want from her. I really really enjoyed the freedom of being single prior to being with her.\n\nIn the last couple of days I decided it'd be nice to move out to my own place when our lease is up (in about 5 weeks). Not surprisingly, she is very upset about it. I'm looking for a bit of clarity on whether it's worth trying to get over these issues or if it's better to cut my losses? I'd appreciate any insight you guys could offer!","chosen":"asked to move in together, she moved in with me.

Text gives me the opportunity to read what I am saying to make sure it makes sense, whereas I seem to have conversational ADD and say shit that makes absolutely no sense sometimes. So it seems the only way that I can actually capture a girl's interest (Shit on a stick robbed me of homecoming queen at uglyville high school) is to actually establish my personality (the non-retard that I am around my friends) with them through text, and then work my way out (or in, depending on if you are Barney Stinson or not)\n\nI didn't ever initiate conversation with the two I wasn't dating specifically to sleep with them, and I have been romantically interested in them both.

We have been together for a little over a year. \n\nThis weekend one of my boyfriend's friends from high school, Emily, came down to visit our college with a group of her friends. This was my first time meeting her, she seems really nice, and she has a long distance boyfriend of around three years. Last night started out with me studying at the library until about 10pm because I have an exam next week. Emily came in during the afternoon and has been spending time with my boyfriend and some of their other high school friends. After I got enough work done, I joined Emily and bf and we went out to bf's frat last night. \n\nShe was supposed to spend last night at a hotel with her friends, but instead she ended up staying with my boyfriend and I at his frat until around 3 am.

I was fine with this because my boyfriend assured me she would not sleep over because I told him that it made me uncomfortable. He said something to the effect of \"I love you and would never cheat on you.\"\n\nHe says that they were chatting and it got really late and they both ended up really tired so he tried to be a nice guy and he let her stay over. She slept in his bed, and he slept on the couch. I feel extremely disrespected because he allowed her to spend the night even though I told him it made me uncomfortable beforehand, and doubly so because he allowed another woman to sleep in his bed and I think that's extremely inappropriate. I don't think he would cheat on me and she and I got along really well while all of us were hanging out. My boyfriend says he was just trying to be a nice guy and not inconvenience his friend, but this makes me feel even worse because that means convenience for her was put above my feelings which I don't think were unreasonable. \n\nWhat do I do reddit?

{"prompt":"So I [26\/M] have been in a relationship with a really nice and cool girl  [24\/F] for about 5ish months. \n\nWhen we first started dating I told her that the contract for my current job is up in May of 2014 and I would be looking at some possible career opportunities that might be in other cities and long distances away. She was cool about it and understood but still wanted to date. We took it as a \"week by week\" approach and a sort of \"we'll see where this goes\". \n\nWe had a good talk about 6 weeks ago that my search was narrowing and my career might take me to a city that's about 8 hours away and if that's the case I'm not sure I could keep up with a long distance relationship. She understood and we kept moving along.\n\nOver the last couple of weeks things are starting to get finalized for me with that opportunity and I've decided that this is a really great career move for me and that I'm going to go for it. I'd still have about 2-3 months left in our current city and will be moving this summer.\n\nI've decided that within this I want a fresh start and don't feel strongly enough about her to want to make it work that long distance.

I had him either cut off all ties with all those girls or we're over. He chose me. I have so many trust issues with him due to being betrayed the first year and a half of our relationship. My family does not like him, even though they don't know about the cheating, so it makes a huge conflict of me going out with him. My mother always interferes with my relationship saying hurtful things about him. He honestly has changed in my eyes but I can't seem to forget about the things he did to me in the past. \n\nAny advice on overcoming horrible past experiences? Or the fact that I will never be able to look past it is a sign that we shouldn't be together. Ask any questions you'd like because I have not gone into great detail really. Thank you for reading.","chosen":"boyfriend cheated on me 3 times in 1 year and 10 months, mother interferes with relationship to the point of ruining it, need advice on past experiences to overcome terrible treatment.","rejected":"boyfriend cheated on me 3 times. trust issues with him due to past flirting\/cheating. need help overcoming horrible past experiences. help plz."}

{"prompt":"Over a decade ago, I was a typical high school student who rode the yellow school bus.  I saw my fair share of people ranging from elementary to middle-school to high school everyday.  Having not progressed in coolness to sit at the back of the bus (freshman year), I shared a seat with a troubled middle schooler who was bullied to no end, and he decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nOne day I was casually talking with him, not being \"friends\", and he revealed his frustration in tears of the bullying he recieved daily.  He opened his bag and revealed a 9mm pistol that he was going to use to \"solve\" his problems.\n\nI was shocked, but I didn't make a scene.  I knew so many people who were ruined by the choices they made, and I didn't want him to be the next.  Having been bullied, beaten, hit, and made an outcast for fighting back, I knew what he was going through, and I talked him out of it.  Explaining to him that he was better than those assholes, and that he had potential for a better future than this course of action was going to take, I offered to dispose of the pistol for him.  He placed it in my bag.\n\nI couldn't go home or find another way back.  I had dismantled the pistol on the toilet, and I kept it on me until I got home in the afternoon.  I promptly threw it away.  I was scared the entire day, but thankfully nothing within the time he was a part of that school district did an unfortuneate event happen.  \n\nI've told no one until now.

{"prompt":"Hi all,\n\nI have an unbeatable job offer at a company in Silicon Valley. I previously worked at this company as an intern, and I love the projects, the people, and the ability to grow and learn there.\n\nMy other option is to stay home or close to home, and start my own gig or take-up a job there. Why would anyone ever consider doing this? Let me explain.\n\nMoving across the country and away from everything I've ever loved is very difficult for me. It also means I lose my SO or at the very least a long distance relationship for a while ( which doesn't work ). There are complex reasons based around her certifications that don't make sense for her to move. She has been a life changing person for me, and is truly someone I want to have a future with. For context, we have been seriously dating for almost 2 years. \n\nOn the other side, I feel like I'm throwing away everything I've worked for. I spent my entire childhood, college, and free-time working towards an opportunity like this. I would be throwing away a huge compensation package, and the ability to learn things and meet people that I could never do anywhere else.  When I was at this company as an intern, I had all of these same perks, but I felt so empty not being able to do any of the things I loved growing up. \n\nThe advice that I'm seeking is about how crazy it would be for me to throw away this offer. The reason it scares me is because if it weren't for this girl, I would be on a plane tomorrow. I don't want the relationship to go sour and be kicking myself in the ass in a year or two. My hometown has opportunities for me to do very well, but it's not even on the same scale.","chosen":"potential job offer in Silicon Valley, love the company, but staying in my hometown would be throwing away everything I've worked towards.

{"prompt":"My fiancee today had a bit of a breakdown and at first kept saying I didn't really love her, I was just staying with her ( my first gf ) because I hadn't experienced anyone else. I told her this wasn't true, and I loved her and was happy with her. Then it turned into a \"its always about you, you, you..\" and how she always does so much for me as if I don't do anything for her, don't adequately show her affection and don't make her feel loved. I asked what I could do differently, what more she was needing \/ wanting and she couldn't answer. I do my best, and I know I'm busy with school and work, but it's certainly not a 1-sided relationship. Later on I lay down next to her and after a while she says she is afraid of only being with 1 person, and missing out on experiences. \n\nI feel like she is really wanting to break up with me, but I think she is afraid to. We've been together for 5 years now, and haven't had any big relationship problems. I don't know where this is all coming from. She did just take a 3 day trip to see a friend from high-school in a different state, but I trust her and don't think she cheated on me. Maybe I'm just ignorant and missed a lot of the signs, but I feel like this is all a really quick turn around on how I thought things were going. I'm really scared to bring up the topic with her, and we haven't spoken for about 5 hours now, I've only seen her when she walks past me to go to the restroom where she closes the door (which we never do. no idea what shes doing in there..) and stays inside for 10 minutes.

{"prompt":"So, a buddy mine approached me today, asking for a favor.  He's was on Plenty of Fish and met a cool girl he really liked and got along with.

Growing suspicious, he asked her for a photo confirming her identity.\n\nNote: Photo has been altered to hide her face.  There's no photo on her Plenty of Fish profile, but she did have a Skype profile image,which matches this one.\n\nSomething seemed off about the photo to my friend,and I offered to take a look  at it, since I'm pretty familiar with Photoshop and altering image.  I took one look at it, and it looked damn fake to me, based on the text on the card.\n\n1- The zeros on the card appear to be identical\n2- The 1 and the p's lines are completely vertical\n3- Little pixelation around the text, even at when magnified.\n\nNow it's totally possible this is a legit photo, maybe the girl just keeps it around for verification and digitally adds the date as needed.

{"prompt":"We've been going out for two years, and we've been having a lot of trouble lately. Normally, we're happy as two people can be. But it's been hard.\n\nHe has a lying problem. He's had drunk conversations with women, then not told me about them until I went through his phone. I know going through his phone is normally a big no-no, but every time I've done it, I've found something. And he's promised me complete transparency. Still lies, just deletes more texts now.\n\nWe had a huge fight, and he apologized about a thousand times. Swore to God he'd never do something like this again. Told me he'd learned his lesson by almost losing me. Said I can have access to anything I want, anytime, even though we've tried that before.\n\nSo I gave him a sort-of ultimatum: if he EVER lies to me about something he shouldn't again, I leave him then and there. Now I consider that a sort-of ultimatum because in most relationships, faithfulness is expected.\n\n**The Plan:** I want to send a sexy message to him from a fake profile. I mean, I want to make it legit, too. Not obviously fake. Maybe even just start with a normal conversation and see if he'll let it evolve into anything further. I want to see if he's really changed, or if he would at least tell me this time. I want to see if he'd respond, then immediately delete the message. I just need to know his reaction. He's a very handsome dude, and I feel like this exact scenario would happen to him in the future, anyway. So I'd like to know before hand if he'd make the same mistakes again.

I'll start to give him one and if he was doing something on his phone, sometimes he's continued looking at that for several minutes while ignoring me.

{"prompt":"I am a 23 y\/o female and my boyfriend is a 24 y\/o male. We have been together for one year.\n\nA few months ago I was snooping on his Facebook messages and saw he had messaged a girl from his work. It was a pretty casual, friendly conversation, with maybe some slight innocent flirting (he said to her at one point \"it's a bummer we don't work together more often!\" for example). She was also very beautiful, so I freaked out. I am beautiful too but I have low self-esteem, so I completely thought the worst, as in he contacted her because he was into her.\n\nSo I discussed it with him and apologized for snooping. He was very understanding and told me she was only 17, so he definitely didn't see her that way, and that it doesn't matter at all because he loves me and would never cheat on me or leave me for someone else. He said at that time he messaged her, she was having \"family drama\" and had been talking to him about it at work. He saw she was online and decided to see how she was doing and cheer her up.\n\nI guess my concern still is that is it normal for guys in relationships to talk to their attractive coworkers outside of work? I personally don't use instant messaging so I find it hard to relate. My boyfriend is an extremely friendly person, and I know for a fact he is friendly with everyone at work, so maybe he is just the same way online? I just can't seem to get passed how pretty she is and think he was messaging her because he wanted to talk to a pretty girl:( He had text messaged and talked to this other girl from his work in the past but I never batted an eye because she wasn't prettier than me in my opinion.

{"prompt":"A year ago, my current husband and I got married. My sex drive is very high but he approaches sex differently. While he does have a libido, he approaches sex with me the same way he would approach jacking off. It feels the same - like I am a full figured fleshlight. Also he finishes before I do, he always state that he is sorry and we can try again later but every session is the same. He doesn't take pleasure in pleasure, he just approaches it the way he would a job. He does say he wants me to finish as well, but usually that means he will just lay back and let me be on top while taking the time to catch some extra z's. I have tried to give him tricks and hints but to no avail. I could try to talk some more but I feel like it is fruitless to try and engineer a*\"desire\"* to please.

I would never have imagined that a relationship that is healthy otherwise would be damaged because of a sexual misalignment. But now that I am married and in my 30's it seems I want nothing more than an emotionally and sexually fulfilling sexual encounter . My husband is very traditional and conservative so there is not much flexibility. Admittedly, the relationship has its emotional deficits too. I am quite conservative myself.

{"prompt":"Short backstory, girlfriend and I have been dating for several years - recently moved in together.  She was a virgin when we started dating, I was not (and she knew that). I had several serious girlfriends prior, and had done a fair amount of experimenting - she hadn't. She also suffered from some body issues previously (very thin at one point, healthy but still thin now).\n\nI always thought at first she was just shy since she'd never had a serious physical relationship before, but after several years of dating (and sex) she is still pretty shy and uncomfortable about being naked. I took things extremely slow, tell her how beautiful she looks, ask her if there's anything I can do differently etc but it hasn't really changed much. We still have sex a few times a week, and she enjoys it (though certainly not \"loud\" or \"wild\"), but she rarely instigates, doesn't like being naked, etc.  Other than that we have a very healthy relationship and I know she loves me tremendously (and she knows I love her)\n\nIs there anything I can do to make her feel more comfortable? Or do I just accept that she will never be comfortable naked or the type to pounce on me randomly?  I feel like it's related to the body issues she faced but I'm hoping for some XX perspective (hence the throwaway account name...). \n\nThanks in advance!","chosen":"girlfriend is always uncomfortable with being naked when we have sex, is there anything I can do to help or do nothing?","rejected":"Girlfriend has had a very thin body before and is now very uncomfortable with her body, what can I do?"}

So the reason I want to end things is for one, I'm just not happy any more. We see each other about once a week and it has just started stressing me out instead of the opposite. She has started dealing with depression and actually gave herself bruises on her legs because she says she hates herself. I'm always extremely supportive but it's just stressful taking care of her all the time. She must call me once a day crying.\n\nMoving on. We have a trip coming up on the 11th. We have been planning this all summer, but as that date closes in, i feel more and more like I'm going to be miserable the whole time and it's just going to make it harder to break up later. I can cancel by the 7th with no fees or repercussions but i still don't know if I should. She has been saying things like, \"i don't know what I'd do without you\" and \"im so excited for this trip. Im just so sick of it here\" (we are living with our families until school starts again). It is all just making it very difficult to decide what to do.

{"prompt":"I'm a male and studying at University for nearly four years and I don't live at home unless it is the holiday periods. \nMy father has a very short temper and is very aggressive. He used to beat me, older brother and mother up when we were younger. Now he is older he wouldn't dare to try it now. He still has eruptive angry arguments where he will threaten to kill my mother or just shouts out her and tells her to get out of the house. I'm still dumbfounded that my brother and mother who still live in the house put up with this crazy behaviour. I have lived away for nearly four years on and off because of University and can't stand it when I'm living back with the family in the holidays.

That was a real crap example but I hope you understand that what I am justifying is he doesn't operate rationally as a human. He will never talk out a problem instead but will choose the angry approach every time which involves cursing and swearing and shouting as loud as he can. When he is unhappy with someone he will rant to another person about the other offending person's flaws and what he thinks they have done wrong etc (He always thinks he is right as well). I have not asked him if he will seek medical help for his issues because I know very well he will just get super pissed off. If I get him compulsory treatment how will that affect him and my family?

I guess the advice i'm after is whether or not you beautiful people think it's a good idea for me to take her up on the offer of going back to FWB's. I still really, really like her.

I kind of \"blew up\" on her, from what she says, and now she is convinced it will not work out in the long term. \n\nFrom the beginning I was kind of iffy on being with her because we had different beliefs. She views herself as a  Christian Scientist and I view myself as an Atheist. Her belief is that sickness is merely and illusion and can be corrected by prayer alone. She dislikes that I rely on medicine and science to cure my ailments. So, that is where our future comes into play. I want to vaccinate and take our future kids to the doctor and she does not (unless they are really sick). Her argument is that her family does not vaccinate and they are fine, so why should she inject her kids with diseases so they do not get those diseases? I try explaining to her, she has researched vaccinations, but she still thinks it is stupid. \n\nIn addition, she claims we are not compatible because we do not share similar interests. She watches TV with her dad, and reads books (vampire, erotica, sci-fi). I reddit and play video games. We met in college and we are in the same profession. We go to events and do other activities and when do we have fun together. My problems with her is she is openly racist and classist (her familiy is wealthy and she looks down on poor people, I grew up poor)\n\nI have suggested we see a relationship counselor, but she thinks the belief issues cannot be fixed, so she thinks a counselor would be of no assistance. She is afraid we will do nothing but argue and she is strongly against divorce, primarily because her parents are divorced.\n\nShe is a beautiful girl and she is very smart (other than the beliefs thing IMO).

Last night we had the talk, and while we do still care for each other, she just wasn't wanting to be in the relationship anymore and had felt that it had run its course. While it does suck on my end, there's not a whole lot I can do, and I really do think the best of her even right now. Chances are we'll see each other again, maybe even an occasional hookup if we're both single and feel like it, but our lives are going in two different directions and a relationship just isn't going to work.\n\nBut really, that's not the problem. The problem is that now I have to explain to folks that we've broken up, and I don't want to give them the wrong idea that it was a bad breakup filled with gnashing and weeping, laying in the fetal position listening to Nickleback. I really don't want people saying some bad shit about her when I mention that we've broken up, but I feel like it's going to happen when I say \"We've broken up\" and they'll just respond immediately \"Oh man, well she sucks, you're too good for her.\" At the same time, I don't want to come across as being hung up on her, and that's why I'm refusing to say anything bad because that's not true. The relationship has run its course, but I literally can't say anything bad about her because there's nothing bad to say.\n\nSo, what's the best way of letting folks know we've broken up, but without giving the impression I'm mad at her or that I'm still pining after her?","chosen":"GF broke up with me, I don't hate her but I don't want other people trying to comfort me by calling her a bitch, wat do?","rejected":"My girlfriend broke up with me, and I feel like I need to let folks know this without giving them the impression I'm still mad."}

{"prompt":"I always thought it was just my father doing things my father does. My younger siblings find it quite funny because they don't know how to react to it, and compare it to Gollum. \n\nHe's already seen a doctor and has been diagnosed with depression.

He also doesn't seem to view his behaviour as strange or unique in any way. \n\nHe's very intelligent, interesting, successful in his field (he works extensively with electricity, which may be why he makes verbal calculations about it, and often leaves random calculations scribbled in my notebook if I leave it lying around) and although he has a odd way of socialising, he makes many friends regardless. I don't know if it's worth trying to get him help or at least speak honestly with a doctor to try and get a diagnosis when it doesn't seem to particularly negatively impact his life.

In the old days, I never really noticed her, but lately I've kinda been fancying her. She never really stood out among her friends, but from small interactions that I've observed, she seems like she could be a really cool person when you get to know her.\n\nI haven't the faintest idea of whether she'd be interested, though.

I definitely don't want to ask her out right now because it would be Awkward City if she turned me down (I would still want to be friends with her and hang out if she's not interested in romance.)\n\nAlso, one of the other guys (Ted) seems to like her too, but I'm not sure if they have more of a brother\/sister dynamic.

{"prompt":"So I got called in to work today, which is awesome for me because I'm looking for all the hours I can get right now.

I stare at him for a moment, unsure as to whether or not he was seriously asking if I am putting eggs in an OMELETTE, one which he's seen me make numerous times by the way, and then I decide to call him out on his dumb question. He then flips out on my \"attitude,\" and rants on and on, all this over HIS dumbass question (No, I did not use the word dumbass to his face). Seriously?? \n\nAs well, he seems to be a lot more judgmental and close-minded then I thought he was when we first started going out. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him, constantly thinking about what he would say or complain about what I'm doing. More often than not, I'm right about what he's going to say, and it's always some form of criticism about what he thinks I've done wrong, whether he thinks I'm cleaning something the wrong way, or cooking something the wrong way (and I'm a great cook, I always get raving compliments on my food from others), to raising our child the wrong way, and on and on.

On one hand, we were broken up, she told me about it and was honest, and I really want to get back together with her. On the other hand, i don't want to be her backup plan.

{"prompt":"This happened last night. We had just moved in to our first home yesterday, and after a long weekend we finally got to just relax in our living room for the first time. At about 10:00pm my wife got a bit restless and wanted to go for a walk. We left our phones and keys at home because I just wasn't worried about anything in this neighborhood. \n\nAs it turns out, we have one of those fancy door knobs on the front door. When it locks, it will let you open the door from the inside but the door knob stays locked. I am only used to two types of door knobs, those that won't open unless you unlock them, or those that will automatically unlock if you open it from the inside. So we get back and I try to open the door and it won't open. We walk around the house hoping against hope that there's an open window, which of course there isn't. The back door (sliding glass) is locked with a door stop in the trench, and our garage door, which is not currently working was bolted shut. \n\nThe reality of the situation starts to set in that..we have only a few options. Wake up a neighbor on our first day moved in and ask to use a phone to call a locksmith, walk about a mile to the gas station to borrow a phone and call a relative so they can call a locksmith and save us some embarrassment, or break a window on the house we just moved into. We figured replacing a small window would be cheaper than a locksmith.\n\nStill in denial, we went back to the front door to see if I could twist the knob hard enough to force it open (lol). Not happening. Then my wife walks over to our security sign in the yard, picks it up, and uses it to pop open the door like you would with a credit card. Completely dumbfounded, the irony was lost to me until my wife pointed out that we broke into our house with our home security sign.","chosen":"Locked wife and I out of our house on our first night moved in. wife used security sign to pop open front door like you would with a credit card. hilarious.","rejected":"Locked wife and I out of our house due to not understanding door knobs.

He apologized and said that he meant I could be more \"studious\" (she had been working on a scholarship essay when she asked me to read it over for her, during which she and my boyfriend talked to each other).

{"prompt":"Repost from the anxiety subreddit, with an update at the bottom.\n\nFor starters, I have social anxiety disorder. I've been struggling with it since I was about 11 or 12. I'm now 24. For the most part, I was able to push through and pretend like thing were alright. I was able to deal with the fear and the stress and still function. But obviously with constant weight on my body every day.\n\nHowever something recently made my anxiety so much worse. I lost my pregnancy in the middle of September. Since losing my pregnancy, my anxiety has increased (not surprising). The problem is that it's gotten so bad that I now can't sleep without my boyfriend present. And if I do sleep, it's extremely choppy, split between fear as I'm awake, nightmares when asleep and an overall depressed mood. My boyfriend has a weekly ritual meeting with his group of friends for a project they've all been working on for a while. The meeting carries on into the early morning, so I do end up having to go to sleep without him. It's a day\/night that I dread.\n\nI feel like I'm losing myself because he is the only thing keeping me sane. I have to rely on him right now to keep myself from breaking. He's the only one who coaxes me back to reality when I have an attack, he makes me feel safe when he's around, I sleep so much better when I'm touching him. If I don't touch him, I'm bound to get nightmares.\n\nI apologize that this post is not very detailed, it's one of those nightly meeting nights, and I have to sleep without him.\n\n----------\nAs an update, it's the morning after. He crawled into bed an hour before I was suppose to get up for work. I couldn't face the world. I am absolutely terrified. Of what? I don't have a fucking clue. Everything. Nothing. It doesn't make sense, but it's happening. Being in a constant state of fear while not actually having a reason to be, warps my reality and literally makes me feel insane. I honestly feel I should be admitted. This isn't normal.

{"prompt":"I'll try to make this brief. I'm from the Midwestern United States if that helps. \n\nMy cat is about 7 years old and very active and loving. Recently I noticed she's been getting thinner and not eating or drinking water. I thought she was just being moody because I went on a business trip and my SO cared for her alone for the first time. After 2 or 3 days of this she started puking up yellow bile so I took her to the vet. \n\nSo, there is something wrong with her liver. I wish I could say exactly what but I was so upset when the vet was talking to me that I kinda shut him out until he got to the treatment options.

{"prompt":"I've had an OkCupid account for a couple months now. Met a guy who lives about an hour away who's a 40 year old PhD student (I'm 20). Anyhow, we had a successful date, and after an extended period of witty emails\/texts\/phone calls, we agreed that I'd spend the night at his place. He picked me up, we went back to his apartment and had dinner, etc. \n\nAt some point, he mentioned that he loved a UK tv show by the name of \"The Mighty Boosh,\" but that he had a hard time finding streaming episodes online. I had my laptop with him, so he gave me his wifi password and I torrented the three seasons for him. \n\nIn the morning, he gave me his USB drive so I could copy the files from my laptop. I created a folder called \"new folder\" and copied the files into it. While they were in the process of copying, I accidentally bumped the laptop and unsafely ejected the USB drive. When I re-inserted it, I used my mac search utility to search for \"new folder\" on the USB drive.\n\nA couple results showed up, and I clicked one. Suddenly, a stash of child porn. I'd say 13 pictures in total. Then, in a subfolder of that folder, another folder with more pictures that looked like child porn. None of these photos looked like they'd been taken by him, they looked like things he'd pulled off the internet. I looked at the image properties for one of the original 13 photos, it says the files were created in 1996. \n\nI copied the entire flashdrive's contents to my computer because I was about to go back home, and I didn't want to bring it up and then get stranded in a strange city with no way of getting back and little\/no cash. \n\nShould I say something?

{"prompt":"Our annual household income has averaged about $240,000 per year (varies slightly based on bonuses) the last 3 years.  We need to consider any tax efficiency we can, and we are already maxing out retirement accounts.  \n\nWe have saved enough cash to buy a new home.  It is a spec home and building will be completed early January 2017 and the purchase price is $458,000.  Our current home is worth $210,000 and we owe $160,000.  The mortgage is 15 year and we pay $1500 per month. (We still have $2,000 per month left over after all bills to save). Rather than sell, I am considering renting it.  A long term renter would probably pay $1700\/month to live in it.  I think I could revenue about $3000\/month via an airbnb rental (keeping in mind there are more costs like utilities, basic cable, cleaning, furnishing).  I haven't decided yet since I have to consult with a CPA on tax implications and such, but in general does this seem to be a decent idea?  I have set a \"make me move\" price on zillow in case anyone wants to make us an offer on the house sometime in the next 6 months.\n\nHere are some other costs of the property:\n$2,400 per year property taxes\n$900 per year homeowner's insurance\n4% interest rate on the $160,000 balance.  \nPurchase price was $190,000 5 years ago so depreciation would be $7600\/year based on the 25 year schedule.\nLawn mowning:  $700\/year\nelectric, gas, water:  $3,000\/year (this would be a write off if airbnb property I am assuming).\n\nAdvantages of selling the property would be getting about $40,000 to put into the new house or pay off a vehicle that has $800 per month payments.

My wife has been becoming friendly with the parent of our daughters' friend. This guy is just a real douchebag. I have nothing but dislike for him but our kids are friends. My wife has started to talk about him a lot. I know they text. I see her dress up way more than necessary when they are together. They are way too close and the relationship is really not one that makes me feel particularly great. \n\nIf she is cheating it would make me furious.

For the longest time, if I could cheat, I would. Nothing ongoing or with her friends but a large number of one night stands. My wife does know to a degree. I was caught once when we were dating and once more in 2005. We've since worked out our issues. \n\nI don't know if she has cheated on me in the past or not. I've never really got caught up on it since we lived really separate lives for a long portion of our relationship and to be honest I was very active on the side.

Last January I got injured and couldn\u2019t run for a while. The physiotherapist suggested going to the gym to train my core and back muscles. It turned out I looove lifting weights. I feel so badass doing overhead presses, and feeling badass makes me incredibly happy.\n\nI\u2019ve always been slim, especially my upper body.

Furthermore, \n\nhis university is two hours away however he comes home every weekend ( we don't live together but we're in from the same town) and since he doesnt have a car and there is no direct train connection, he is reliant on people giving him a lift. he could easily afford a car, he used to have one until it broke 3 years ago, however he prefers to spend his money on take out food, clothes and booze.

{"prompt":"About three years ago I was friends with a group of people, mostly guys. I don't really keep in touch with them anymore, but I'm still friends with one of the girls and she invited me to her wedding!\n\nWhen we were all friends three years ago, I ended hooking up with one of the guys. First time make-out, second time sex. Him and I were never really friends and never really talked before or after it happened. We generally avoided each other after it happened. As things tend to go everyone in the group eventually found out that we did it. While a tiny bit awkward, I don't really mind. If I ever hung out with the group after that, it became a joke.. something one or two people would quietly tease me about if we were drinking.\n\nFast forward to now! That group still hangs out but I'm not part of it. We will all be at the wedding. I'm pretty excited that I have a boyfriend I can invite and show off.

I could explain if that happens but wouldn't want him to think I was hiding anything or feel stupid for being in the dark about something other people know about. On the other hand, if I tell him, I guess I would just say that I hooked up with one of the guys but that we never dated and it wasn't a big deal. However, then I would have to point him out, or tell my bf his name, and he would likely be on the lookout for said guy during the wedding.

{"prompt":"OK in high school there was this girl I liked that I wanted to ask to our winter formal with the intent of dating her afterward.

So grudgingly I go to build a bear looking super out of place feeling really awkward just trying to buy a damn bear. So the next school day I wait before classes when we usually talk to ask her, and everyone is asking me \"what I have in the bag?\" So I show them and every one says good luck and stuff when my \"friend\" Vince walks up and sees that I was going to ask her out. So later I see him talking on the phone I immediately think he might be calling her, but then I think that's ridiculous and calm myself down. Little did I know she was sick that day. And the next day. And the next. So for three days I sit there in the morning with that bag waiting for her. Then one day I see her at lunch and present her with the bear and everything asking her.

We never ended up getting married. Without getting into specifics, she was emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive to me.\n\nI know I should have left earlier. That's not to say I didn't genuinely care for her. I loved her very much, but I knew her behavior was wrong. Her threats of suicide, self harm, infidelity, and false claims to police kept me from doing anything about it. Eventually it just because normal to me. Finally after one of her multiple week mean streaks I snapped.\n\nI put some of my things into garbage bags and moved into a motel. I tried for months to patch things up and get her to go to counselling with me, but all I got in return was bait-and-switch emotional abuse. Once I finally gave up I moved out of state to get away from her.  \n\nShe isolated me from all of my friends. She tried and failed to do the same with my family, who are very supportive and loving. I'm so thankful I have them, but I really have no friends or even acquaintances.

{"prompt":"I am a 19 year old male, in a 8 month relationship with a 19 year old female.  When I was young, my divorced mother had a few relationships with fairly shady men.  My father later told me he was worried about my sister getting molested.  Around the time she was dating the men, I started to have nightmares about getting molested, but always awoke and brushed it off as a bad dream.  I just started remembering these memories lately, and have spoken to my girlfriend about it.  \n\nI mentioned that I feared I was molested, because of \"new\" memories that feel sort of alien to me.  It's like watching bits and pieces of a movie, just snippets of images, although nothing outright damning.

I had a violent emotional reaction, and a rush of these snippets of images.  I am an empathetic person, and a very sensitive guy.  I told my girlfriend about this and sheepishly told her that I may have been, but am not sure.  She's been nothing of supportive, which I appreciate.\n\nI guess my real question is this:  I'm scared of facing the truth, but I'm also scared that I was never really molested, and that this is all just a creation of my imagination.

This continued right through the summer. \n\nThis September, we both began graduate programs and started to see one another less than we had before. In December, he broke up with me. Nothing big happened to cause the breakup aside from drifting apart a bit (which I felt was natural given our grad programs); I think that he just didn't know what he wanted in life.

{"prompt":"Hey there Reddit,\n\nHere's the deal. I've been living in an apartment for a about a year now. For the last 2 months or so, my upstairs neighbours (who I've never met) have had a dog living with them who occasionally goes outside onto their balcony (directly above mine) and pees. Our balcony floors are wooden slats, so some of it drips though onto mine.\n\nI'm not sure if it happens all the time because I work full time, but I think it might because sometimes I come home and their are very small puddles of liquid (which I'd presumed to be water) on my balcony, even if it hasn't rained. This being the case I think that they may have trained the dog to pee outside without really considering (or caring) that they've essentially trained their dog to pee on me.\n\nObviously this is not the greatest of situations, and I want to send them a note or contact them in some way so that it can stop. The only problem is that I don't really know how to approach it. I want to be firm and be clear that it's unacceptable, but also not come off as a busy body or too aggressive given that I've never even spoken to them before.\n\nHowever, there is one slight problem. My housemates and I have cats. They are both fully house trained (they only ever do their business in their litter) and are never allowed outside onto the balcony without one of us present. Our building doesn't allow pets, but our actual landlord said he didn't mind us getting some before we got the cats. I just want to be careful that I don't piss off the people living upstairs so that they don't rat us out for our cats and leave us so we have to get rid of them or move. I'm not even sure the people living upstair know we have cats since the cats are rarely outside, and we rarely see our neighbours outside either.","chosen":"Dog upstairs keeps pissing on our balcony.

We have lived together in the past for 2 years and currently for 2 plus years. Our current lease has the better part of a year remaining on it. I care for her greatly as a friend and we see each other as being very close almost like sisters. \n\nThe problem: We have some lifestyle differences (mainly in the housekeeping department) that in the past I have been able to live with\/overlook but lately I feel almost like I am taking care of a child and at some point it feels like I'm being taken advantage of although not intentionally. These things are impacting my life, my mental state,  and have even started to influence my behavior towards her. Bottom line its come to the point where it needs to be discussed. \n\nI understand that things should be brought up as they occur, as part of healthy friend relationship communication but her reaction to small requests can be quite over the top. So, I have pretty much avoided bringing things up because her reaction is basically a sort of punishment in and of itself.\n\nAdditionally, it has come to my attention that the care of her small animal is inadequate and its state of well-being is compromised.

We've gone out for some drinks and talked about life. She was always super encouraging. \n\nFor the program we have to complete an internship in order to graduate.

Cost about 100$ .\nWhen we were dating he did talk to me about how he doesn't really like diamonds because of where they come from [blood diamonds] and I totally understood. But I didn't really think he was THAT serious about the reason. It kind of made me wonder if he was just trying to cheap out or if he actually cared about the blood diamond.

Mind you , he does have the means to get a very nice ring.  \nI agreed with him and told him the marriage is what counts , who cares how much someone spends , it doesn't mean he loves me any less. \nAfter a year of marriage , my ring is now scratched on the diamond and it's obvious to the eye. So when I mentioned to him maybe it's time for a new ring, he said there's no way he's spending money on another one. \nHere's my thing, he's been engaged twice before.

Yesterday I had to buy something on ebay, so I used our joint paypal (We shared a lot of things, being brothers. Paypal was one of them. It seemed silly at the time to have different accounts since it would all go to the same address. Stupid on reflection, I know). I was curious and looked back through the history and found out that a few months before he moved he had taken my iPod and sold it on ebay. \n\nThis hurts, because he has always had money problems, yet every weekend he would drive four hours to see his girlfriend. No one in the family liked her except for me, and I often stuck up for my brother in family arguments. Now he's stolen from me. I don't even give a crap about the ipod, its just glass and plastic, but its the fact that I was living with someone that would do this to me, even after I was literally his only friend (excluding the gf, of course).

{"prompt":"Hi loseit, I'm wondering if I can find any help or motivation around here. A little back story for you before I explain where I am now:\n\nSince middle school, I've always been overweight. I was in the 180's for most of my teenage years, at 5'4\". I think the highest I got was about 185 and size 16 jeans. I was miserable. Went through all of high school never having even been on a date before. Went to prom alone, the whole deal.\n\nSo I decided to do something about it. My first year of college I lived at home, and had a great support system through my family that helped me to lose weight. I lost almost 40 pounds in 6 months, got down to about 147. It all kinda halted when that Summer I went on vacation with my mom, and ate whatever I wanted for 2 weeks straight, thinking I'd get back to the diet when I got home... no idea why I did that. Obviously, I did not get back to the diet. I have maintained for about 5 years at around 150 - 155, but I'm not happy with it.\n\nMy problem isn't that I don't know what to do with my diet, or what or how much exercise I should be getting, I know that stuff... I just can't figure out how to get down to my goal weight, which is around 125 - 130. I have a great boyfriend, I don't despise the way I look (just not in love with it), my life is pretty great, but... I just want to be healthy and NOT overweight for once. I've tried to get started again so many times, and have had success at first, but then I always just bounce right back and give up. I don't know how to get that motivation again to really STICK to my plan. I suppose the difference between now and then was that then I had a lot less temptations. I don't deal with temptations well.\n\nAny tips on motivating myself and avoiding temptation? I did do one cheat meal a week when I lost weight before and that worked, but for some reason I end up having multiple cheat meals, and then it just backfires. I would appreciate any advice. :)","chosen":"Lost weight 5 years ago, didn't make it to goal weight, having trouble finding the motivation.

{"prompt":"Our relationship was amazing at the start and I love this guy so much.\n\nWe have been dating for 5 months.\n\nOne month into the relationship he went to Australia for a month and while he was there he promised me that he wouldn't watch porn. I have a problem with porn because it is a horrible industry that degrades women, chews them up and spits them back out. I think that if he watches porn then that means I'm not enough for him.\n\nAbout a month or so after he got back from Australia, some of my friends were telling me how they thought it would be impossible that he's gone a month without watching porn. So I asked him, and he swore that he had never watched porn. I asked him numerous times over the next month if he had, always denying it. Then, one day last week I asked him again and he came out and confessed to watching it once about a month ago. That infuriated me because he obviously can't tell the truth to me. And worst of all he cheated on me with porn! \n\nI can't trust him anymore.\n\nWith this newfound untrustworthiness, I decided to look through his Facebook messages with his exes to see what else he was hiding or lying about. I found out that he had talked with his ex about gross things like rape, something about Japanese girls, and incest. (He said he wanted to fuck his cousin.) I got angry and called him out on this and he said he only said those things because his ex was a creep and he said those to make himself seem like her because he was insecure. \n\nI also found out hat he lied that his ex had been to his house.\n\nI told him it was over.\n\nI still love him though, I really miss the guy he used to be before I found out this stuff.

He wants it twice a week and I have a hard time getting in the mood a few times a month. He has said many times that a few times a month isn't enough for him. I don't know what to do because doctors have no fix to help me.\n\nWhen I force myself to let us have sex I hate it and am just waiting for it to be over. Little things (like the feeling of the hair on his legs or being freezing cold) take over in my brain and start to annoy me until I have to stop. When I'm not in the mood I really don't like how sex feels. Sometimes it becomes uncomfortable. I want our sex life to be enjoyable for both of us.\n\nAfterwards I am often left very angry because I am broken and I can't seem to enjoy what everyone else is able to. This anger starts to take over and is affecting how I feel about him overall (not just sexually).\n\nI have looked into seeing a sex therapist but I have not been able to find one that will accept our insurance and we can't afford to spend around $200\/hour without insurance.

{"prompt":"My friend never got a parenting plan in place right away after separating from her daughters father.  Now she's is struggling with him to agree.

This has worked up until dad decided to take a night job and doesn't get off until one in the morning. Mom has had daughter stay at her house during these times he works, but dad is showing up and trying to pick her up at 1am. Also note dad is trying to put her in a over night day care instead of allowing her to stay with mom. She has now filed in the courts and is awaiting mediation to try and reach an agreement. In Colorado, if he places her in day care over night what would stop mom from picking her up. Again there is no custody papers in place legally.  Also would it look bad on her in court if she does this.  My opinion is the child is better off with a parent rather than a third party, but again it was a verbally agreed parenting plan.","chosen":"friend separated from daughters father and is struggling to reach agreement upon child's residency. waiting for mediation to resolve custody, would it look bad in court if mom were to pick up child over night?","rejected":"my friend separated from daughters father without a parenting plan. have filed in court to reach agreement on child's residence. would it look bad in court if mom chooses alternate day care."}

{"prompt":"Hola dog lovers! I recently adopted a dog, [Eevee]( who is the sweetest and cuddliest little thing I've ever met.

We can tell she was trained by whoever had her last time, because she knows how to sit and [play dead]( and usually how to walk on a leash.\n\nSo my question involves something that happened with her this past weekend. We had her outside and were playing with her, letting her run in water from the hose. She had no problems, was loving the water on her and drinking from the hose. Then, someone flicked the hose like you do when you're trying to get someone far away from you wet. She freaked out! She ran to where the water landed, barked and ripped up grass roots and all!\n\nLater, someone was playing in the above ground pool. She did the same thing whenever water splashed over the side. There's wooden stairs and a platform leading up to the edge of the pool. When someone got out, and water dripped between the boards, she ran there and started digging out the stones they have surrounding the pool and barking some more.\n\nI don't think she's afraid of water because she is fine with baths, rain and the hose, and even went up on the platform and was trying to drink the pool water. I think she would've jumped in if I hadn't caught her.","chosen":"Dog freaked out\/barked\/manipulated water by barking and digging out the stones in the pool to get the water.","rejected":"My new dog ran away whenever someone stood in the water from the hose."}

{"prompt":"Hello! This is my first post, I've been lurking for a while, sorry if the format comes out crappy(I'll fix it if it does). I have something I wanted to ask here since I haven't found any good answers while searching on google. \n\nI recently purchased a used 2012 Camaro from Carmax at the end of May this year. I was approved for a car loan from Carmax with a term of 60 months, a 5.90% interest rate and the interest is calculated as simple interest. The amount of the loan at the time of signing was just shy of $17K. I made the first payment the beginning on July(45 days after signing the loan). Currently I am paying an even $300 a month even though the actual amount due every month is ~$281, and the amount left is ~16K with the payments I've made(on-time) since buying the car. \n\nMy credit situation isnt terrible my credit history is just very young(~1 and 1\/2 years old). I dont have any student loans, old credit card debt, or outstanding medical bills. I also dont have any late or missed payments on my credit history. The only debt I carry besides the car loan is my 1 credit card from my bank(which I pay off in full every month). The credit card started out as a partially-secured card back in august of 2013, with a limit of $500. Approx. 4 months ago, they removed the partially-secured status, and increased my limit to $2k. I recently made an account on Credit Karma, and my estimated credit score is 696. \n\nNow on to my questions: Aside from saving money on interest, what positive and negative effects would re-financing the car loan have against my credit score? Is right now too soon to try and re-finance the loan? Should I wait until I've made more on-time payments to re-finance?\n\nI've started thinking about this recently especially after seeing re-financing offers on Credit Karma(not that I would apply without doing research) as well as offers from my bank to refinance the loan with advertised interest rates of 2.49% with a possible discount since I've been a customer with them for a while now.","chosen":"Bought car loan from Carmax, want to know if it's a good idea to re-financing, if so, how much to re-financing, and what negative or positive effects would re-financing the loan have against my credit score.","rejected":"I want to refinance my car loan, but I've never made a payment in the last 6 months.

To make a long story short, we had an amazing time together. I ended up sleeping over at her place that night. We fooled around a little but didn't have sex (which I am happy about--a girl that fucks on the first date isn't usually good relationship material and has low self-esteem, in my experience anyway).\n\nI had to leave the following day (this past Sunday) and return home.

The following day I went to the CVS minute clinic that's down the street and the nurse prescribed me Neomycin,Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone ear drops. 4 drops in the ear 4 times a day. Basically, the infection got better but as time went on the severe ear pressure in said left ear got worse. I decided it was time to go see an ENT. The Dr. said the ear drops had built up in my ear. He then used a tool to clean out my ear-a little power washer type thing to clean out the ear with water. He said my right ear canal (the non infected one) was a bit red, but everything else seemed fine. He told me to come back if needed. 3 days later I was so frustrated, I decided to go back.

Should I go and sit down with her and talk to her when she eats dinner by herself in the kitchen (I usually already have had dinner by then)? I have had problems with roommates in the past and I think maintaining some distance is good, a roommate relationship is essentially a business relationship, not an instant friendship, However I keep feeling I am ignoring her and she might be lonely and she is seeking out other friends and hanging out with them because I don't offer her any companionship.","chosen":"How much am I allowed to be distant from my roommate and still keep the rent paid and make her happy?","rejected":"I don't care for my roommate, but I don't want to be a jerk and make her feel like she is in the way.

I work in a dead end job which I don't want to to make a career out of and I'm turning 21 soon, my present for 21 is a trip over seas to England where I will work and save money to travel around the United Nation. I don't know whether to accept this present and put off going to uni for yet another year or just explain I don't think it's a good time in my life to travel considering I have close to no money saved or any future to come back to.

{"prompt":"So long story short this was my first real girl friend. First hold hands, first kiss, first round around the bases, ect. We went out for 2 and a half years with absolutely no problems. She was my best friend and I cared for her at least as much as my family, still do in a way. I ended up breaking up with her during our second year of college, mainly because I knew she would not do it herself (which I found out later to be true). \n\nWe have talked rarely since then as her new boyfriend has cut off all communication from me. Never really had much closer since he started this the day they started dating, which turned out to be the day after we broke up. Old hurt feelings aside, I do feel that I have gotten over her although I have nightmares about our relationship all the time. Ranging from us being together and falling apart, to us living happily, to fighting her bf, all of which are far more vivid than the other dreams I have.\n\n Has this happened to anyone else? I would like if my subconscious caught up with my present self (nearly two years since the break up). I am a different person now and it is getting old.

The AT&T lady asked him for his password, and she told him that he had the wrong password. He started saying something to her and mid-sentence, he just screamed \"FUCK\", threw his phone down, slammed his chair onto the ground, and kicked some stuff in his room. He later apologized for acting like that in front of me and said it was because he hated phone customer service.\n\n2. I was over at his house and he was running a few minutes behind for work. His roommate's cat ran into the basement, and he got really pissed off (it wasn't supposed to be down there, apparently). He grabbed the cat from the basement, brought it upstairs, and threw it across the kitchen. Then he cussed at it. The cat wasn't physically harmed, but I personally would never throw a cat.\n\nHe was so angry during both of these incidents that it kind of scared me. He went back to normal fairly quickly though.

But my doctor also said that the MRI showed something weird, possibly bone or something on or around my pelvis\/lower spine area. He said \" I honestly am not sure what exactly it is or what is going on down there\", So he is ordering a CT scan so he can figure it out before he starts planning the surgery.

{"prompt":"Hey there! I'm new here but I'd like some advice. So my now ex-girlfriend and I had broken up about 3 weeks ago because of how we were both busy and couldn't really see each other outside of school, but she was very indirect about it. (It ended in me thinking that we were just on a break but after a while, I figured out that by break she meant breaking up.) She still wanted to remain friends and walk with me to classes and chat and stuff.\n\nWell fast forward to two weeks after the break up (when I realized that she broke up with me and it wasn't just a break). I felt kind of overwhelmed and began to over-think things. A mutual friend had told me that she did the same thing to her last boyfriend (asking for space, saying that she wanted to get back together) but never did. This thought caused me to over-think even more and I felt utterly confused. So the following day, I asked my ex for some space, saying that I was going through some things.\n\nI quickly regretted it, I guess because of how foreign it felt and how I didn't fully understand the meaning of space until it was given to me. I tried talking to her 2 days after I asked for space to swallow my pride and ask for my friend back. But when I sat down with her to tell her, we kept being interrupted and I guess that point never got across. I feel so awkward with her now, since I see her everyday. \n\nI want to be on good terms with her, but I don't know how to get out of \"space\" and how to mend a friendship. She's a great person and I'd rather have a friend than no one at all. I just don't know what to do... \nAny advice would be very helpful, thank you for your time!","chosen":"I asked my ex for some space after the break up, and now I feel awkward with her and don't know how to help it.","rejected":"Ex and I broke up, still friends.

Now fast forward to present day an I haven't forgotten about her and I think I would go back to her if I had the opportunity (I know it's dumb but I cherished what we had) one of her friends has told me that she misses me and regrets doing what she did and that she wants me back, I was seriously considering doing it but one of my mates keeps telling me that she cheated on me and I'm conflicted.

{"prompt":"Back in October, I started a new job and there was this guy I found very attractive. I hit on him relentlessly which caused a friendship to form. We'd meet for coffee between our shifts at work and talk a lot. In November I admitted to him in a drunken stupor that it bothered me that of all the men I know, he's the only one I can't fully tell if they're attracted to me or not. He wasn't entirely sober either, and said that he was attracted to me, but in a sexual way, not a relationship way.\nI figured whatever, and let that go. A few weeks after that, he and I ended up hanging out outside of work and hooking up. That then turned into a regular thing where we'd hang out at least once a week. The first month or so each time we hung out, it was always involving a sleepover and sex. Then eventually it turned into my going over after work and we'd just talk, watch tv\/netflix, and sleep, with an occasional sexytime. \nNow, it seems that he and I talk more than anybody else I talk to, and I know I'm who he talks to most too. We have a regular schedule for hanging out. (Everyday Wednesday and Sunday I go over after work, and occasionally there are other days too.) \nOver the months I've tried convincing myself that I'm just okay with the whole FWB thing, but I'm not.

{"prompt":"**Background:**\nWe met on social media, and immediately kicked it off. After the first date I told her that I liked her a lot, which is rare for me after my last relationship of slightly over a year ended up with my ex cheating on me. My ability to trust in others has been affected after the past relationship, so I was quite surprised when felt genuine attraction towards this woman. She told me she needed more time to think about what she wants from this relationship, because she needs to leave to go to school in three months, and if we started something, it would eventually turn long distance (about 2 hours apart). After hanging out with her more and more, she eventually told me she felt the same as me and we decided to give the relationship a chance.\n\n**The Problem:**\nNow I don't mean to be a pessimist, but I can't help but to feel like our relationship has been doomed to fail, just because she has to move away and I would probably only see her once a month from then on. it is a feeling of deep anxiety and dread to know that I feel this way now, even after I worked so hard to get into this relationship. I've talked to several friends about it, but they haven't really said anything useful except stuff like \"Long distance never works out.\" So my dilemma is; should I just enjoy my time I have with her, and see where it goes from then? I've never felt such a strong attraction to a person, and although I've been in relationships before, this seems like the first time that I'm already hurting before we even break up, as if I'm afraid of a life without her in it. Now, I am fully aware I sound like some love sick fool, but that's why I'm asking you guys, I need guidance.\n\nWhat advice do you guys have for me? The most logical thing I've assumed is to try to establish a strong relationship foundation with the time I have left to make things work out?","chosen":"Really like this girl, started dated recently, but with the knowledge that she has to move 2 hours away for school in 2 months time.

{"prompt":"Where to start.. in 2003-2004 I was dating a woman who was also in the Army. We fell in love, and being stationed apart ultimately broke us. It was not a good breakup by any means. She was going on her first deployment to Iraq, I was \"getting out\". \n\nFast forward to 3~ months ago. After 10 years of no contact at all, not one word. We both emailed each other within a week to separate email accounts. We've since discovered that the feelings we had have done nothing but grown over the years. \n\nWe are about to give our relationship a second chance. She is getting out of the army in November of this year, I have been out several years now. She has been deployed 3 times as a flight medic. We don't speak about her deployments unless she initiates the conversation. She is very uncomfortable with that part of her life, and is always grateful that I \"was never deployed\". \n\nThe problem is, after we broke up, I stayed in and did 2 tours in Iraq, and one in Afghanistan as a Forward Observer. I have never told her this. She thinks I got out during our breakup. Every time my time in the Army has come up, I just sort of smile and nod and sympathize. Saying things like \"yeah I'm glad I got out before I had to experience what you went through\" etc. \n\nI do not want to start our new relationship carrying this. I feel it is unfair to both of us. I've pretty much accepted and worked through everything I had on my plate as far as wars are concerned. I am very worried telling her the truth will make her, I'm not sure how to word this. I guess make her feel less important to me, since it would put us on the same level? \n\nIt is a very sensitive topic for her in general, and the last thing I want to do is hurt her -or- start our new relationship with a lie.

She suffers from depression and I don't think she'll do well with me moving away. My dad passed away when I was 4 and us kids all she has, as she's very isolated.

The travel there is long, I takes me 90 minutes to get there and another 90 to get back. I'm not really a social person so I'm not doing it for the party life. I want to make something of myself and when I'm at home I rarely get the motivation to revise and end up becoming really depressed.

According to my friends that I was with, it was blatantly clear that she was into me.\n\nI was skeptical, because I knew she had a boyfriend and she was also drunk. However, she started talking about how shitty her relationship is and how she used to have a crush on me in high school and a bunch of not subtle things like that. She then dragged me out onto the d-floor to dance. She was really getting into it, and I think she wanted me to kiss her, but I refrained because she was drunk and I wasn't. Eventually her friends (who were her ride home) came and told her that they were leaving, so she told me goodbye and hugged me. I told her to text me and she said that she would.\n\nShe still has not texted me. So how should I interpret this? Was she just drunk and lashing out at her boyfriend?

She told me that I \"don't want anyone to know we're married\", and accused me of being too worried about what other people think.\n\nAt this point I did lose my patience a bit. I told her I get upset that she doesn't consider my constant praise valid unless it's posted publicly on Facebook (that's the recurring argument that tends to come from this). I also said that I thought she was being very entitled in expecting people to praise her photos.

{"prompt":"Hey y'all. Thanks for taking a bit of time to read this. \n\nI met Jessica a few weeks ago on tinder. We talked for a bit on the app, I asked her out and got her number. We agreed to meet at a cool coffeehouse\/restaurant\/bar. We ended up staying and talking for 4 or 5 hours. \n\nWe didn't really talk after the first date, but then I asked her to go hiking. She agreed, but plans changed and we ended up spending the evening at my place, watching movies and the like. \n\nWe ended up making out, I gave her oral, we tried to have sex, but my nerves and a bit of alcohol resulted in me not being able to get it up. \nShe was cool about it and we just watched more tv before I took her home. \n\nI was extremely embarrassed & worried that I had ruined my chances with her. However, I ended up texting her a day or 2 later to invite her to a social event later in the week. She ended up telling me that she had plans to visit family, but responded in a way that told me she was dissappointed that she couldn't make it and that she was still interested in me. \n\nWell I like keeping communication when I'm \"talking\" to someone, and tried to text her, but my attempts have been ultimately futile. She only responds to my messages hours later or the next day. She also has never texted me to initiate a conversation. \n\nThe last time I messaged her was Friday night. Since I didn't get a response I decided that it was time to just wait it out and see if she wants to hang out sometime this week (she went out of town for the weekend).\n\nSo, does the evidence point to her not being interested, or is she perhaps just not a fan of texting? I guess I'll find out this week, but I just don't like feeling like a chump when I try to initiate but get little response. Just kind of sucks because I thought that both of our dates went (mostly) really well.","chosen":"I'm not sure if Jessica is still interested. She's been very vague about communication.","rejected":"We went on 2 dates, we had sex, I'm no longer interested in her.

{"prompt":"So my boyfriend and I have been together for six months.

{"prompt":"A few weeks ago, I had a dream I was driving with some friends westbound across the I-90 bridge into Seattle. At the time, the bridge was about 80-100 feet above the water and only the middle express lane existed. As we first pull onto the bridge, we noticed a huge green military tanker jet clip a wing into Lake Washington near the other side. After it crashed, everyone flipped out and stopped their cars to try and help survivors. \n\nAs people on the west side of the bridge were trying to help passengers get out of the water, we were trying to rescue a bunch of dogs on our side. The only problem was that we didn't know how to help the dogs get out of the water since we were so far above them.

It also had a bunch of sharp and sticky plants stuck all throughout its fur which made it really difficult to hold.\n\nThe thing is shaking and cold, so naturally I feel bad for it and all of us decide we should keep it.

This continued through elementary school, gradually becoming less as we made other friends and saw each other less. However we were still very close at this point.\r\rWhen we started middle school, we got closer again as we prepared for the transition and wanted the security of having someone we knew and trusted.

We both joined the newspaper club that year though, and became pretty close again. The club met two or three times a week, so we saw each other more.

{"prompt":"Title is confusing and probably a strange situation. I live in Upstate NY, to start. My mother is getting a divorce from my abusive father of over 30 years. She has an order of protection against him, but the judge has still allowed him to work at his auto shop on the property. Despite an invisible line he isn't allowed to cross, he still has pretty much done whatever he pleases and the police don't care.\n\nThis brings me to one of the outer barns on my parents property (the deed is not only for our house, but the auto shop bays, and two more outlying barns). One of these barns has a stall that houses our family horse for the winter time as it gets very cold here. My father decided he was going to put a padlock on the entrance to the barn (this same barn links to other places in the barn where he has expensive cars) and now my mother can't get in. She requested through her lawyer to have something done, and she apparently filed an injunction (I don't know what that is, just what I was told) to get my father to unlock the door for the horse's safety, but nothing has happened and this has been ongoing since the summer.\n\nMy mother's lawyer also said were she to try and break off the lock which is his property, despite the barn being marital property, my mother could be arrested. I don't really understand what is going on here, maybe small town politics and the fact that my father is well known in the community, but I really need some advice. My entire family is worried about this horse and the barn is where we have always put him in the winter time and now it seems like we don't  have any options. We tried last year to board him elsewhere when the divorce first started and my father refused to let the horse leave the property.","chosen":"parents are in middle of divorce.

He needs a lot of time, between playing with him or just cuddle him.\n\n It was really hard at first because, as the veterinarian told us, he's hyperactive.

This was on my smart phone.\nThat night she goes on my phone after I told her to look something up on it (we were trying to find directions to a restaurant), and notices that I tried to log onto OKc and only thinks that I am looking for others behind her back\u2026which I\u2019m obviously not.  I love this girl so much; she kinda has some trust issues that just became exacerbated by this incident.  I told her I had nothing to hide and she seemed leery but agreed.  I still feel like she doesn't trust my answer\u2026and I want her to believe me.  She says she can only hope that I\u2019m telling the truth and there\u2019s no way for her to know for sure unless I tell her\u2026she hopes that I would be mature enough to tell her if I was doing something like that.  \nIs there anything I can do to regain my gf\u2019s trust?","chosen":"Gf thinks I am looking for others behind her back; I think she doesn't trust my answer.","rejected":"Girlfriend saw something benign but may think it's something more sinister."}

I got a pretty pissed off with this as shes never seemed to have time to do anything after work but sleep. So she texted me and i just didnt reply and now its been 3 days and we havent spoken at all.

So I told she was spineless for not being able to say it to my face because I know you are going to take it to social media after this. She refused to speak. I told her she doesnt actually care about me and she just doesn't realize it. She just shrugs. So I said maybe you do realize and you're just trying to use me. She shrugs again.

His speech is slowly getting better, and his doctors seem optimistic, but I couldn't help being disappointed when we saw him today and he still couldn't say my name.\n\nWe've always been extremely close, and I would easily rank being able to have a peer-to-peer friendship with him as the best part of adulthood.

I'm not actually bothered too much by this. A lot of good can come from some transparency in government.

At the same time, however, blanket carpet-bombing the internet with everything classified WikiLeaks can get their hands on, is a terrible idea. \n\nThe international community has to remain confident in it's ability to negotiate with the US in confidentiality. They need this to negotiate worst case scenarios, and situations in where any outcome is a bad one, and our governments work to try to do the lesser evil.

I go to the store, buy her a present (a CD, we're both in band together, it seemed fitting), and I tell her that I like her, and I hope she has a happy late Valentine's. She tells me that she likes me too, and the conversation is over after that because we have different classes to get to.\n\nFast forward to now- we've been spending a lot more time together than ever. I have intentions of trying to ask her what she thinks in terms of a relationship (seeing as we both openly like each other), or something like that- but any time I try, I always chicken out.

Then I jokingly asked her if I was going to regret any of this,  and she said she would \"be sure to remind me lol\".  \n\nThe one thing to note about her is that she has been with only one guy in her life (told me this) and is very inexperienced in that regard.

He just seems kind of zombieish. I know he isn't happy at work, but he rarely if ever talks to me about it. He says he doesn't want to add to my stress. Then I just feel worse.\n\nI know I may just be projecting my own anxiety and fear. But I've also heard the first year of marriage is the hardest.

I understand there was no obligation for either of us to do anything.\n\nWe shared all kinds of personal information that two regular people wouldn't share online and I was fairly happy with the direction things were going in.

{"prompt":"Your body burns calories.  You provide the calories by eating food, storing excess as adipose, using adipose to supplement deficiencies, it's an amazing system.\n\nCalories in < calories out and you lose weight, it's as simple as that, how we manipulate the formula is where it gets complex, some people like to exercise a lot to give them leeway on the calories, some are sedentary and rely solely on restricting input, and everything in between.  As long as we get the in less than the out, we burn fat.\n\nThe time of day that you put the calories into your body has a statistically insignificant impact on this calculation.

Ok, I understand. \n\nLately though his jaw has been better and he went down on me a few times. Twice he woke up with a sty in his eye. The second time he said it was because he'd gone down on me. Honestly this has to be a coincidence. I shower daily and always clean up before sex. I think the sty\/subsequent pink eye is either due to stress at work or maybe not washing his hands after. Regardless it's insulting that he would even imply this and has not gone down on me since. \n\nI'm pretty frustrated. I feel almost shallow for complaining but I really miss oral sex.

{"prompt":"So this past year at college I made friends with a guy (call him Chris). Chris seemed like a really cool guy, but soon I found out he was very toxic.

I dated this girl for only a month and then we broke up, but Chris was still really angry at me. Eventually Chris \"forgave\" me and we became \"friends\" again. I started hanging out with him a lot, but I started to notice that he made fun of people all the time and that he was a very angry person. I basically put up with Chris up until the end of spring semester at which point he and I both went home. We continued to talk but then I decided that I wanted to cut Chris out of my life and I just stopped talking to him. \n\nHere's the issue; since I stopped talking to him he sent me a really nasty message to \"fuck off\/ eat shit\" because I was meeting up with someone that was in our friend group (this person I'm meeting with doesn't like Chris that much either) and he was really angry about that. I didn't arrange this meeting on purpose to piss him off, but somehow he found out. Also Chris graduated so he won't be returning to the college next semester, but I keep having this anxiety that he could try to hurt me, because he knows who and where I'm living with(it's a small college). How should I handle this situation? I would try to talk to him, but I feel that it's impossible to reason with him.

{"prompt":"Hey everyone,\n\nI am a junior in high school right now, and I am just beginning to seriously think about my future (including college). Last year, when I discussed what courses I should take in Junior year with my college counselor  he suggested I take some of the easier courses in subjects i'm not the best at to boost my GPA.

One night I was talking to him about why it hadn't worked out between him and my friend. We were both a bit drunk, and he admitted that it was because he fancied me but knew I wasn't big on the whole emotional attachment thing. Well, this threw me because I had been trying not to admit to myself that I liked J for a while - I'd been trying to keep it strictly sexual with him, nothing emotional because that's how people get hurt. I stupidly admitted this to him and he suggested that we become 'exclusive friends with benefits' - ie, we don't shag anyone else but each other. Thing is, it's not just sexual anymore- he knows a lot about me, things that would put any normal teenage lad off (I have a history of mental illness and a dysfunctional family that I'm not wild about people meeting) and we talk a lot about pretty much everything.

{"prompt":"I was with my long term boyfriend, let's call him Bob, for 2 years. He was my first love, we swapped virginities, he was truly my best friend and the person who knew me better than anyone. This fall he headed off for college a few hours away, and I remained in our hometown for my senior year of high school.\n\nI developed a crush on another dude, let's call him Joe. I told myself that if I even had a small crush on Joe, my love for Bob couldn't be real. Now it's a few months later. My crush on Joe didn't last, but I ruined my relationship with Bob over it.

I think I still have feelings for him, and I keep wondering if I should pursue getting back together with him and trying to rekindle what we had.

I have known him a long time, I know when he is lying, and the \"new office girl\" is making him a fibber. \n\nHere are my concerns;\n\n1) When he is more involved with someone at work than he should be he is more prone to bringing up that person over and over again in conversation, the new girl has been brought up A LOT recently.\n\n2) He will say rude things about the women in his office, I think in an attempt to make me think he's not interested, but this is how I know who the attractive girls at his job are. For example, the new girl has been called \"gap tooth\" even though I have seen her facebook and I know that yes, she does have a gap in her teeth, but the rest of her is adorable. So freaking lame of him.\n\n3) He will suddenly get VERY enthusiastic about having sex. Last week he was all about my boobs suddenly. I have good sized breasts but they are mostly ignored as he is an ass man. New girl happens to have large breasts as well, and I dont think it's a coincidence  that this girl with big boobs starts working there and all of sudden my husband is all about my breasts.\n\nAll of this kind of crap annoys me to no end, I feel like when he is having sex with me, he is probably thinking about her, and that makes me want to punch him.

We said \"I love you\" a few months back, so it did move a little quick in comparison to some of my past relationships.\n\nA few weeks ago, she had a conversation with me that she thought that I wasn't as into the relationship as she was. I assured her that I cared for her, it's just we express it in different ways. She expresses how she feels in actions, and I tend to use words.

That advice had worked out, but considering we are already friends, I didn't do things too differently. \n\nJump to last week and my best friend, also the girl's good friend, who has been playing matchmaker for us, setup a double date. It went went pretty smooth, and I made subtle moves I had never made before. My advances were well received with good vibes. **I know kissing is big here on reddit, but I DID NOT KISS HER. I didn't feel it was the right time to do so.**\n\nTonight, I am going to an event near this girl's house and happened to see on one of her social media pages that she isn't feeling too well. This led me to ask her if she needed anything and she made a request for a specific dessert item. I will be delivering the snack to her before the event.\n\nShe is 22 and I am 21. I know her through my best friend, the matchmaker mentioned above. I've known her since December, and I am aware that she may possibly like me also.  \n\nSo Reddit, I am in need of your advice on what I should do or how I should handle tonight's interaction to maximize my potential of a future relationship with this girl.\n\nP.S.

{"prompt":"I am 22 and I've been seeing my boyfriend (25) for around 3 years. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to add the usual discaimer here! My boyfriend is just a lovely guy and I enjoy every minute we spend together. It's almost embarassing how I turn into a character from a 'Romeo and Juliet' adaptation whenever I'm around that guy!\n\nHowever, there is an issue which I don't think he takes that seriously but I can't seem to get over. After dating for 2 years, he cheated on me with another girl (a mutual friend) when we were all living together (but not) at college. Obviously, this was 'not cool', and I left him after I found out. This was an extremely painful time for me, especially as it was the first serious relationship I was involved in. Also, because of the difficult living arrangents, I never really told anyone else what happened. It seemed easier to just cleanly break it off and avoid becoming the focus of gossip.\n\nHowever, things do change. I met new people, did well in my studies, travelled Europe and all that stuff. So when, a few months later, he gets back into contact with me, I let him close enough to apologise. One thing led to another and we started dating again.\n\nOverall I think it was the right choice, I know people make mistakes and since then I think that the dynamic between us is improved now. I'm not so clingy and he's been more willing to show me a bit of attention. I knew it would take some time to heal from this, if ever, but when I took him back I knew I would have to forgive him if it was going to work out...\n\nYet, it's been over a year since and I still find that this is a source of stress for me. I hate being suspicious and want him to have fun and be social, but a part of me cringes every time I see him with a female friend (ok, any female!).

We of course have the occasional disagreement, but the one thing we can seem to come to an understanding on is my relationship with my ex. \n\nToward the beginning of our relationship BF expressed some concerns with my being friends with ex.

I'm often excluded when my friends do something together, so I've basically cut off a decent chunk of my friend group since this kept happening and I was feeling worse and worse. That leaves me with not very many people in my life that I truly enjoy spending time with, and I am worried that my constant negativity will drive them away as well.\n\nI just want some advice on how to start feeling better about myself and how to not worry about other people.

{"prompt":"I think my grades are pretty much down the gutter now. I'm in the most important year of high school (junior year) and I have an A, A, B, B, D, B right now, and I feel like that's not really worth anything to get into a UC (especially as an Asian). \n\nI was informed of the IGETC route, and was planning to take the CHSPE in order to leave high school after junior year. During junior year, I was hoping to take some classes in community college. My brother and cousins suggested this route if high school is not my thing, and it'll help me get ahead by a year. However, my sister and mother are extremely against this, as this will mean that I will drop out of high school and they want me to transfer directly into a UC.\n\nMy original plan was to take winter intersession classes and get rid of the easy ones first, such as art. Later in spring, I'd take Econ classes because I'm considering going into accounting. I would take all of these classes at the same time as my high school classes, but I feel that it might be too much to balance.\n\nMy second plan was to take the CHSPE and drop out of senior year to go straight into community college. I wouldn't have to worry about balancing my high school and college grades together, and I'll be able to completely focus on college. I felt like this was the better plan, because I don't want to get mediocre grades in two schools instead getting a really good college grade that would be a lot more important. \n\nHere's the conflict. My sister and mom don't want me to drop out of high school to go into community college. Honestly, I feel like I can't even compete for a UC. However, my sister is saying that I'm perfectly capable and that she's seen people with even worse grades get accepted. She's saying that I should basically go with my first plan, to balance out high school and college.

The marbling looked awesome and I really thought I was getting a great cut.  I was cooking on Christmas eve so I unpacked i, let it rest uncovered in the fridge with a simple salt & pepper rub on it for 24 hours.  I pulled it out around noon on the 24th to come to room temp before going in the oven in a few hours.  I made up a simple herb butter mix that I rubbed it with before going into a 200 degree oven (internal temp of 45 or so at this point).  I should mention, I was using the serious eats method of cooking low and slow for a few hours until I got into the 120 degree range and then searing off at a high temp to get an optimal crust.  It seemed like we were on track and I pulled it out after 3 hours or so at 122.  I didn't remove my electronic probe but I tested it at varying depths and got everything from 121 deep to 131 shallow.  I was thinking this was right where I wanted to be as I would get some carry over and get me close to medium rare to medium range.   It sat for 20 and then went back in at 500 for about 10-15 minutes.  I didn't bother monitoring temp any more at this point which I regret.  I took it out with a beautiful crust and began to serve.  I had to deal with less than optimal carving knives my brother had and found it nearly impossible to get through a fatty section right in the middle of the roast that ran the entire width of the roast.  I was basically hacking pieces off and it was more rare to medium rare for the most part.  I know some of you may be into that but that's not family's preference.

Still in pure friend-friend way.\n\nAfter that night, we started to chat a lot, we started going out. And last two weeks we are real couple.

{"prompt":"Hola Redditors,\n\nI want to explain my situation and hear others opinions on what my plans are. So in July 2014 I was traveling through Santiago Chile and I met a girl via Badoo (Tinder). We met at a coffee shop near her house and 2 hours later we were in her bed. We had an amazing night and she messaged me the next night for the same. I told her from the start I was passing through and she seemed okay with this.\n\nWe had these 2 nights together and then I kept traveling through South America, but we continued to chat every day. Then she decided to buy a plane ticket and meet me in Sao Paulo Brazil for an 8 day \"honeymoon\". She rented us an apartment on AirBnB and we had an amazing week. At the end when she flew home she gave me a book of love notes she had been writing me, leading up to her visit to Brazil. I loved it and truly felt she loved me.\n\nFast forward 5 weeks and I was back in Canada when I decided to take a chance and fly back to Santiago to live with this girl. She welcomed me into her (our) apartment and we've had another amazing 3 months living together. Going on picnic's, playing games, having disagreements and making up, holidays, birthdays & I've met her family maybe 10 times and they seem to like me.\n\nI feel think I'm in love and see my future with this woman. We've discussed in detail our future, moving to Vancouver, having kids and a dog, decorating our house, etc. My question is this: I've known her for 6 months now (minus a week), is it too soon to ask her to marry me? I've heard 1-2 years but I don't feel I need to know anymore about this girl to know she's the one. I'll never know everything and I'm fine with that. There is some other reasons to move faster because we have talked about marriage in Chile with her family and moving to Canada in May which leaves us 5 months to do all that. But I don't think those facts are pressuring me to move fast.\n\nThanks for any tips\/advice.","chosen":"Met girl via Badoo, 2 weeks later moved to Santiago Chile for a few months, living together now, is marriage too soon?

{"prompt":"My SO and I had been together for about a year and then went through a period of being together on and off. The main reason it has been like this (at least in my eyes) is her lack of independence from me and in her life. She has not held down a job for more than a month at a time, her parents  pay her rent and will give her rides when she asks, and she often fails to address medical and mental health issues that come up. \n\nSo at the beginning of the month we had a long conversation about all of this, and some of her friends shared similar concerns with her when she discussed our issues with them. She was eventually convinced by a female friend of hers to enter a few week long womens group and one on one therapy program. Her friend said that it really helped her get a grip and find her direction in life.\n\nJust before she began going to the program we talked again.  I said that what I think we really need right now is time apart and to limit the time we talk to each other as much as possible. I made it clear that I still care about her a lot but it's becoming increasingly frustrating to deal with her dependence on others and her inability to deal with lifes harsh realities. She was upset, but said she wants to do whatever she can to have a healthy relationship and also expressed a strong desire to get a hold over her life.\n\nSo my questions are: How can I be sure that she actually wants to and is going to make real lasting changes in her life?

Last year, I came home for my lunch break to find a shirtless male stranger in my bed. I totally freaked out because I didn't even realize she was in the room.

I said that what I think we really need right now is time apart and to limit the time we talk to each other as much as possible. I made it clear that I still care about her a lot but it's becoming increasingly frustrating to deal with her dependence on others and her inability to deal with lifes harsh realities. She was upset, but said she wants to do whatever she can to have a healthy relationship and also expressed a strong desire to get a hold over her life.\n\nSo my questions are: How can I be sure that she actually wants to and is going to make real lasting changes in her life?

{"prompt":"So to begin, when I was about 11, there was a summer in which I was abused by an older neighbor. For the most part it wasn't really something that weighed on my mind much at all throughout my teen years but I had enough going on that I didn't really do any dating in high school. In college though I quickly got a girlfriend, the first real relationship for either of us. Long story short, we \"dated\" for a little over two years but it mainly consisted of just hanging out watching tv in each other's arms. Our first kiss didn't happen like a year and a half in and physically things got no further. It was incredibly frustrating to me to not make a move or even express myself that our break-up happened over Facebook. It ended without me ever telling her what happened to me back then. \n\nI've done no dating since then but I've just started trying to get back into it. I've had a few first dates and one second date, with things not progressing for the typical reasons. But what's been on my mind a lot more now is what will happen if a date DOES lead to a serious relationship. I don't want to keep this thing hidden from someone I love like I did last time, but I don't want to feel like I'm using it as a crutch for not showing affection or advancing physically or whatever. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice they could offer?

{"prompt":"When I went outside this morning, my car was gone. I frantically called my landlord, asking if he'd for some reason spontaneously decided to have me towed, but no. I called all of the local tow lots, nothing. It started to dawn on me that maybe it had been stolen, so I called the cops. In the four hours that went by between me calling the police and one actually showing up, I got a text from my ex boyfriend. It said: \"guess you won't be able to get to work to see your new boyfriend now, huh?\". I took this as a pretty clear confession that he'd stolen my car. We broke up more than six months ago, and I ended up having to get a restraining order against him so he'd finally leave me alone. I recently started seeing a guy at my office, and I guess my ex found out somehow. \n\nI tried to tell this to the cop, but the moment I said \"ex boyfriend\" he just rolled his eyes and said that this is a civil matter and that the police don't deal with that.

{"prompt":"I think the story I'm about to tell should belong in a book of \"Ten Most Common Shit that Happens to People\" :P \n\nRewind 5 years, I dated someone for 2 years and wounded up extremely hurt and broken in the aftermaths of the breakup. 2 years later, I finally found someone that I could see myself liking. We casually dated for a few months, with him telling me that he really liked me but was not in the position to start a real relationship. Eventually I became frustrated with our stagnancy (difficult to try hard for another person when you're not even in a relationship). He told me eventually that he thought we were too different (very vague, very subjective, but it is his opinion of us so I can only respect it) and he decided that that was a deal-breaker (I would have liked to try in a relationship first before coming to that conclusion). Fast forward a few months later, he is now dating someone else, someone very different from me but whom he seems to really like. I'm happy for him, but at the same time, the contrast between his newfound love and my singlehood results in my bouts of utter despair and loneliness. \n\nI understand we must grow through our relationships, but it is difficult to drag my feet out of the emotional mud once again. I am typically a very sentimental person, so getting over things usually takes a very very long time. \n\nI'm hoping that my story resonates with yours on some level, so we can offer each other some consolation. Otherwise, advice or words of wisdom are welcome too :)\n\nAnd to anyone who is also going through a breakup or caught up in hard times, everything will definitely get better with time, do not worry!

I talked to her over social media later, just exchanged pleasantries. Nothing more. I don't care if she forgets me. Its more I want to keep that relationship there, no matter how slight.

Have you ever hit a wall where you didn't know how to go about furthering your education?\n2. If so how did you break through that wall and accomplish your goals?\n3. If you're like me and have struggled with math over the years how did you manage to finally succeed and conquer that damned subject?

{"prompt":"I have always struggled to maintain a relationship, this being the longest one I have had yet. She has always made me extremely happy when I have been with her, but we knew that breaking up was inevitable at some point as we both were due to finish university and move to different countries in the next year. However, I still continued to develop feelings for her and she did for me, in what was meant to be a \"fuckbuddy\" situation (later becoming exclusive). \n\nIn the last month I left the town we were in university at, and we both said goodbye, but as we missed each other so much she came to to visit me twice, unplanned. This included meeting my family (something i have never done with a girl). We had an amazing time together and it just made us feel for each other more, the second time we knew we would not see each other again as she is leaving the country for a couple of months, and shortly after that, we are moving to different countries indefinitely. \n\nThis was devastating for me and it seemed for her, but today (only a few days after she left) she rang me crying (very out of character for her, an extremely positive person), and told me she had been drinking and taking cocaine with my group of friends from uni last night, and had ended up sleeping with a good friend of mine. \n\nThis has absolutely torn me up inside, as I was already trying to get over the fact that the only girl that had made me consistently happy would have to part from me due to practical reasons which seem pointless and mundane. However the memories that I had of her comforted me and i could still think of her positively. Now I am completely devastated, I know that whenever I think about her, I will think of her sleeping with him and not the good times we had.

However, for the last 6 or so months, I have found some way to squeeze in \"are you okay\" into conversation several times a day with my girlfriend.

{"prompt":"Alright, so a little back story first. We both met on a camping trip through work. We got along really well, and after a long day of hiking, he ended up sharing his pillow with me (mine had been soaked with redbull on the drive up). Anyways, after the camping trip he asked a mutual friend for my number. We started talking and got rather flirty with one another. The only problem was that I had a boyfriend at the time. Of course I knew this was not the right thing to be doing while in a relationship, but I was really starting to like this guy and we had become really great friends.\n\nFast forward a few months, I am single. And of course still crazy about my camping guy. We were already hanging out a lot, so it was only a matter of time before we actually started becoming a thing. So in January, on my birthday, we kissed for the first time. And pretty much since then we have been together. We see each other at least once a week (we are both busy with school and work), and have had sex numerous times. We also go out to eat, see movies, and just relax with one another. Pretty much what you would do in a normal dating relationship, right? He is an awesome guy and I always enjoy the time we spend together. And to be honest, I am falling crazy hard for him. \n\nThe only problem with our relationship is that we have never actually sat down and had the conversation as to what we are and what we are doing. Now I know I should be having this conversation with him, but frankly I am afraid to approach the topic and mess up what we have been doing since January. \n\nAlso, beyond not defining our relationship, I have not met any of his family, and have not met any of his friends (except for his roommate, and a brief encounter with another one of his friends). Is this normal, per se? If it helps, he is Asian (don't know if it's a cultural thing?) He has met a few of my friends and my brother, but this is only because we all work together. \n\nAnyways, any advice\/suggestions?","chosen":"I have been seeing a guy for almost a year, and we have not defined our relationship.

{"prompt":"To start off, my little guy has bed shared with me from week 2 until now - he is almost 4.5 months.   I believe he is in a sleep regression from what the internet tells me which makes sense, at night now he wakes up and screams to be fed and does it much more often - before he would just gently stir and feed.    \n\nMy husband and I have been trying to get him used to his crib a bit  because we would like our bed back in the next few months, so we have begun trying to gently get him in the crib for naps.   We are setting up some (I believe) bad habits by rocking him to sleep and nursing him to sleep before putting him in there because he wakes up about 20 min. later and is not happy.   He screams.   \n\nI have tried putting him in his crib \"awake\" but somewhat drowsy but he just cries and screams and it intensifies as time goes on.  We have tried to let him just CIO with timed check ins - but aren't comfortable with it, as he gets so intensely upset that he is hoarse and shakes for a good while after we've gone in to check on him.  He also doesn't stop crying when we check on him - it almost gets worse.    Just today as well he started to roll from back to stomach and is all over his crib because he is just going insane in there.  \n\nI guess our challenge is how do we get him to self-soothe when we are putting him down awake and he loses it EVERY time.   \nThe rocking and\/or nursing seems to be the only way he will nap in the crib.   \n\nWe do have a nap routine and bed routine that we do, the room is TOTALLY dark, we have white noise, it is a good environment.

She shared a picture of your dates for a couple of pretty big name artists that are in town later this year. She said \"who's coming?\" In the post and I like the artists so I commented on it saying I liked them and if she had tickets already. She said Ya and she didn't have anyone to go with and I felt it would be awkward if I said I'll go since we just became friends. When she said she had tickets she also said she needed someone else to go as well. We stopped talking after a few minutes of commenting. Then today I message her asking if I could get a discount on a car from the shop that she works at(jokingly of course) and we ended up having a conversation about cars, driving\/racing but nothing else really. She was talking about drifting and I said I didn't know how so she was telling how easy it is. She said that she could teach me if I wanted to learn. I also told her how my favorite car was a Monte Carlo and she told me she could come with me to make sure I'm not getting ripped off if I found one(I have no knowledge about cars at all so that's why). This lasted for about an hour or 2 and then the conversation stopped. I figured she was just being nice saying she could come with me to do these things but I'm not sure.

She's had to help with some of my bills while I got settled, and she still pays for most stuff because I have only been able to find part-time work and I have bad depression that I have been struggling with to handle better. She doesn't like that I depend on her financially, and she feels guilty whenever I do extra stuff around the house or to make her day easier or I tell her she's great or wonderful.

{"prompt":"Anyone in the customer service industry knows that dealing with demanding people day in and day out can wear on your nerves especially since people seem to treat those in a customer service position differently than they would treat anyone else (i.e., not like a human). I have my little ways of keeping my sanity while working in a very busy restaurant. There are two main things I do: 1) When seating someone, if they pleasantly say something like, \"Would it be possible to get a booth?\" I will probably seat them at a booth, however if they walk in and say, \"There's four of us. We want a booth.\" in a very rude and demanding manner, I will pretend to look at the reservation book and then claim that all the booths are taken and they will have to sit at a table. 2) The restaurant I work in has the option of building your own pizza (you check off all the toppings you'd like and hand in your form to your server) but people rarely read the top of the menu which states that the pizzas start with mozzarella and tomato sauce and often select the option to get extra mozzarella cheese, not realizing it already comes on the pizza. If the table has been pleasant to me, and they checked off mozzarella, I will hand in their form as it is to the kitchen but I will not charge them for the extra cheese on their bill. If they are unpleasant, I will charge them for the cheese. It really doesn't take much. Just little impolite things and the absence of basic courtesies get to me, for example \"Hello, how is everyone doing today?\" followed by the response of, \"I'll have a pint of Keiths.\" THAT, sir, is not the answer to the question I just asked.

{"prompt":"I'm completely new to the term property lien. I've heard it around this subreddit many times though so I'm hoping someone can tell me if it is an option in this situation.\n\nI own a small trucking company in Los Angeles that hauls containers to and from the ports of LA\/LB.

I usually charge my customers $100 a day for storage if they request it so can I turn around and bill this directly to the company that owns the container instead of my customer?\n\nA driver of mine suggested I put a lien on the containers I have to force the company to pay the charges I am accruing and if they fail to do so he said I would end up owning the container which would be nice but I see it as highly unlikely to happen.\n\nMy current bills for these containers is nearing $2,000 (just in chassis) which I have to pay to the chassis company to continue using their equipment.

{"prompt":"Hey \/r\/relationships - \n\nMy ex and I split in January after 4 years of on\/off dating through college (high school sweethearts, different colleges, growing apart into different people, etc). The breakup was much needed for both of us to grow and mature as people, and I for one am doing great - taking more care of myself physically and mentally, graduated college, got a job, lost 20 or so pounds - and last I heard (No contact since mid-march) she's doing well too. \n\nI have her blocked on everything (It was a pretty nasty split) but can still see her IG - I saw that she took a guy to her sorority formal, he took her to his, and now I saw a picture that'd indicate they're hanging out over the summer.

{"prompt":"This is kind of long, and making me sick thinking about, but I really don't know what to do.\n\nBackground: In february, my girlfriend of about 2 years visited her friend at another college. She got very drunk and somehow ended up sleeping in the house of her ex (we had a year long break between the 2 years).. She claimed nothing happened and was very sorry about it and it obviously caused a big problem between us. \n\nSince then, we have moved forward and even got an apartment together for next year at school. We have been talking about getting married for a long time and are very serious. I am close with her family and always help them out.\n\nLast week: The ex texted her claiming that in February when she was there, they made out and he fingered her. She had no recollection but believes it to be true. Obviously, I blew up and was angrier than ever. I went over to her house and she was in hysterics. She cried so hard she gave herself a panic attack. She told me to hit her, do anything just to somehow make it better (which I didn't do).  In the back of my mind, if we didn't already have an apartment, I probably would have walked away and never spoken to her again; but I chose to try to make it work because of the complication. We really love eachother, but it is impossible to get this cheating out of my head. On top of all that, the ex works in the same place as me and I see him from time to time.

We\u2019ve been dating a little over a year now and are pretty serious about each other. \u00a0During this time we lost our virginities to each other as well. She is my first girlfriend while she has had several boyfriends but was not very serious about them.\n\nAnyway during winter break we had to start a long distance relationship because I got an internship at a company far from university. She also had to move because her stepfather obtained a job up north in Connecticut. She currently lives with her parents in an extended stay hotel. She has plans to go to a state university in Connecticut next semester but will take a 6 month break from school until then. \n\nMy concern is what the future will look like for us. We\u2019ve both discussed what will happen many times. I\u2019m considering either finding a job in Connecticut so I can be closer to her OR looking for a job in a city with more job opportunities for my degree. She wants to stay in Connecticut until she finishes college which will mean at least 2 more years of schooling. She hopes to go to dental school afterwards. Anyway I am worried that our lives seem to be taking very different paths and will result in this relationship not working out. Even if I move to her in Connecticut it won\u2019t mean she will move in with me as she still lives with her parents who are very protective of her. The likelihood of her moving to wherever I get a job post-college if I don\u2019t decide to go to Connecticut is also quite slim because her parents do not know me that well and she can\u2019t afford out-of-state tuition. \n\nI love her very much but I don\u2019t exactly relish the idea of doing long distance until she finishes dental school (which could end up being 6 years from now since she has yet to finish undergrad).

{"prompt":"My boyfriend and I met just over a year ago. We got on like a house on fire, and after a short few months we became a couple. The relationship had been really great in almost every way since then - we bounce off each other, we went on regular dates etc. Since we met though, I'd always been aware that he was going to be studying abroad for a year from October. This was brought up near the start and was always something that we planned on talking about later on if things looked like they'd last until the time came. \n\nAbout a month ago we discussed our options, and decided that we'd try and give long distance a go, and if it wasn't working for either of us during the year then we would talk about it again. \n\nA couple of weeks though, he flew out for a week to the country he'll be staying in I'm order to find somewhere to live, and we found that week pretty difficult, even though we spoke on Skype every night. When he returned, we decided that it would probably be for the best if we didn't do long distance. Our logic was that if we had trouble doing it for a week then a year would be impossible. \n\nSo yeah, a well thought out decision for the most part. Except now I'm wondering what to do with myself. One minute I'm I'm an almost perfect relationship with a guy I talk to all day every day, and all of a sudden it's just not there anymore. I don't know whether to keep talking to him, or to go cold turkey. Whether to talk about a possibility of getting back together or whether to just move on. It's been quite a disorientating experience and I'm just not sure how to handle the situation now!

Now at the time I had a little bit of acne and wasn't particularly bothered by it, my parents had told me it would go away eventually and that I shouldn't cover it up with makeup as it would make it worse. The stranger went on to recommend roaccutane and my mum got him to write it down for her. \n\nAll the while I was, at this point, pretending to be asleep and mortified with embarassment. It was like they had both agreed my face needed treatment and I felt miserable the whole trip and the memory has stayed with me ever since.\n\nLooking back on it, I know the man meant well and neither of them knew I was actually awake, but it still made me very aware of how other people must have looked at me.","chosen":"Stranger points out my acne when I wasn't all that bothered about it before.

I still have some Red Bull in me from the drive so it was difficult for me to calm down. After my girlfriend and I lay down in bed, we feel the sexy vibe since it's been about a week - but we can't since my grand parents are almost next door to us in the house so we can't do it there.

So we start doing it, and we did it twice within an hour. After chilling out for a little while after we decide to go to bed, being 3:45ish at this point. Fast forward to the next morning, I wake up around noon. I find a note next to the coffee maker that says \"_____ your grandmother saw you doing it in the pool last night.

{"prompt":"So I'd been really interested in a manager of mine who had been working at our store for a few weeks from another store to fill in for another manager who had left.\n\nWhile she was there my best friend had told me that I couldn't go for it because she was a manager and that dating wasn't allowed between employees of the same store, but after he talked to her a bit and realized that her and I had a relative amount in common he concluded that at some point I should in fact at least ask her out and see where it goes.\n\nSoon after that we found out she was going back to her old store, and her last day here was going to be the only day where in her and I were guaranteed to work together alone for an extended period of time.

I have never asked a girl out before and never thought that when I did that one would say yes. I went into expecting to be rejected and being at least content with myself for trying.

{"prompt":"Hi! I've been in my current relationship for around fifteen months. We are currently about five hours apart driving, and for the past eight months have seen one another roughly once a month. \n\nThe only issues we've run into are distance-related. When we're together things are great, and we're going to spend a summer together to get an opportunity to be back in a good schedule like we were before the distance. Sometimes I'm not great at communicating exactly how I feel, for example, and I don't want to upset the balance. But that's all being worked on.\n\nToday I felt something that I haven't felt in a long time. I think this might be partially because of the weather, as silly as that sounds. It's unseasonably warm where I am right now... I was just reflecting on the process of having a crush on someone, building up the confidence to talk to them, thinking day and night about them, worrying, fretting, talking to close friends, all that silly youthful stuff. Granted, I MUCH prefer being in a relationship to this. I love my girlfriend and really enjoy spending time with her. We're different enough to keep one another interested in what we have to say, but share a lot of fundamental things and generally just have a lot of fun.\n\nSo when I found myself thinking about the attraction process, having little crushes and glimpses of romance here and there I couldn't help but feel guilty. I don't want advice on why to break up with her, by the way. I realize we're pretty young to be so serious, but it fits both of our personalities quite well. \n\nI'd love some insight on why I might be feeling like this, and not necessarily how to stop myself from thinking about it but how to better come to terms with it. Any advice? I fully intend on staying with her, and she feels the same. I think that this has a lot to do with distance, and that maybe once the summer comes around we'll both be able to get excited about spending time together and get another glimpse of the whole \"honeymoon\" phase. \n\nAnother point \u2013 we're likely going to be living significantly closer to one another next year.","chosen":"Girlfriend and I are long distance for the next year or so.

{"prompt":"Okay so this tifu happened a long time ago when I used to intern at a project management company. It happened during my first week of work. \n\nSo the company had a main server that contained all the files that people could access and these files were shared among all the employees. I had been specifically told not to touch those files and save them to my computer before using them. \n\nI get assigned some procurement work to finish which requires excel. Being the professional player that I am, I wanted the company template on my document as well. So I go to the server, instead of copying the document to my computer , I use the file directly from the server and delete all their budget and keep the title and hit save. Only that it saved \"weirdly\" like shit happened in the bottom of the window idk. At that point my stomach dropped and eyes widened because I realized something was wrong. I see the folder and yes, I deleted the entire budget from the folder. I'm panicking my ass off since you can also see who edited the budget last. At this point I'm on Google searching for \"I fucked up at work\" with no idea what to do. \n\nI go over to the only other intern and explain the situation to him. He tells me that I will have to do the entire budget again. I ask him how and we go over to the finance department (we still didn't tell them anything) and ask for the transactions receipts. He gave me like 3 files worth of receipts,I take pictures on my phone for all and it took me two days to type them all in the excel. I had no idea what I was doing. On the 3rd day of the fuck up, one of the employees accesses the budget and comes to me and says , \"I think you accidently replaced the budget on the server with your assignment task, I've put the original one back up\".

She has done nothing wrong and doesn't deserve any pain, and I feel like a fucking piece of shit for lying to her face so much, but I can't even muster up enough willpower to tell her when I dont want to hang out, let alone break up with her. And now our anniversary is coming up and I feel sick to my stomach knowing I'm going to have to put on a facade of love throughout the whole thing. I know that the answer to this problem is to just tell her the truth. I'm just so disgusted with myself for lying to her for so long that I would never forgive myself for the amount of pain I'd put her through if I broke up with her now, but I get more and more entrenched in my own lies with every day I let pass. I know there's not a whole lot that can be done or said, but I wanted to see if anyone could possibly offer any advice.","chosen":"I have been lying to my girlfriend about loving her for a long time because I am a shitty weak willed person and cannot bring myself to tell her the truth, but I am also very unhappy in the relationship and don't want to lie anymore","rejected":"I am a weak minded person who cannot believe that I am not in love with my girlfriend, and I'm just getting worse and worse."}
{"prompt":"I've been dating a great guy for the last 9 months, and for the last month or so I've been getting jealous for no reason and nitpicking him for no reason. I want to stop but I don't know how. \n\nThis is the healthiest relationship I've been in for a long time. He's cute, sweet, fun, successful, and crazy about me--everything I've always wanted in a guy. We're talking about moving in together in the next few months. We communicate really well and I think we both try hard to be good to each other.\n\nFor the last month or so, I've been nitpicking him over small things and getting overly jealous. I'm scared I'm ruining a good thing. This relationship is way healthier than the borderline abusive\/toxic ones I have been in in the past. Maybe I'm just used to more drama or I don't know what to do when a relationship is smooth. Every time I snap at him I apologize. He's been really understanding, but I feel like his patience will run out eventually. He gives me a lot of reassurance when I'm feeling insecure or jealous, but I feel like he shouldn't have to. \n\nI just wish I was in more control of my actions.

{"prompt":"My friend never got a parenting plan in place right away after separating from her daughters father.  Now she's is struggling with him to agree.  Right now they have a verbal agreement in place that there child (age 3) will reside one week at mom's and one week at dad's rotating. This has worked up until dad decided to take a night job and doesn't get off until one in the morning. Mom has had daughter stay at her house during these times he works, but dad is showing up and trying to pick her up at 1am. Also note dad is trying to put her in a over night day care instead of allowing her to stay with mom. She has now filed in the courts and is awaiting mediation to try and reach an agreement. In Colorado, if he places her in day care over night what would stop mom from picking her up. Again there is no custody papers in place legally.

I do not have the funds for therapy yet but will be able to start in 2 months time.

{"prompt":"Last year I made a concious decsision to try and better myself, so as a 17 year old junior in high school I started to lose weight after christmas.

Whether it was late night pizza pick ups after a trip to the hospital or pity soda and chips at night at my computer; I was not worrying about my food intake. It also didnt help that thanksgiving and christmas was just around the corner. The total damages were 28 pounds, and I feel noticably bigger.

He doesn't take pleasure in pleasure, he just approaches it the way he would a job.

After meeting my SO, he must have seen something special because not only did he take me as his GF but he decided to pay most of my way through schooling. I'm almost done with getting my double BA in Chemistry and Spanish. I plan to go to Pharm school but I have gained enough financial aid that I will not rely on him for money then.  We've been together for 4 years and I really do love him. \n\n**A Little More Background**: About a year ago I bought a vibrator thinking that it would spice up our sex lives.

It wasn't that I was using it but that I was cleaning out my drawers and it somehow got under the bed and I didn't remember to put it back. When he saw it he started making jokes about me masturbating. Now I don't find it funny and actually quite offensive since I'm not very sexual and it makes me feel like a sex object when he makes those type of remarks. He apologized since he didn't know that it would upset. I told him it's okay since I never really expressed how I felt until then.\n\n**The Actual Problem**: Today after having a great romantic Lunch\/Dinner we were talking and the fact that he's leaving for a business trip tomorrow came up in conversation. It was going fine until he threw in a joke that he didn't want to find the vibrator under the bed again when he gets back. Well I just lost it. I felt so offended, disrespected, and just confused why he would do such a thing. I had told him in the past how awful those kind of jokes make me feel.

Someday, we'll be ready. However, there is no longer any presumption that we \"might\" end up dating. We're just friends. Taking space. \n\nExcept, one day after saying we need space, he's initiating conversation with me, and we're talking like we always did as best friends. This doesn't seem like \"space\".\n\nHe's still the one that I want. But I think I'm going to stop chasing him for a while. I think I'm just going to commit to a very long term friendship with him. If I do this... Is it likely I'll get an opportunity in the VERY distant future to re-enter a romantic context with him? Just be friends for SO long, get to know each other SO well, that we'll just come together again despite the trainwreck of our first attempt and a conscious decision to step away from all that? I can't really \"wait\" for him, but should I consider him not out of the realm of possibilities yet? He has so much appeal to me.

{"prompt":"A little background first. Like most engineers I'm taking differential equations and also solid mechanics. For solid mechanics we have to do a lab in addition to taking the class. Pretty standard stuff.\n\nAnyway, the class had us sign up for labs in groups by providing sign up sheets where we could sign up for which lab we wanted by providing our name and student ID numbers. The lab assignments were posted online today with a column for our names and student ID numbers (which had been blacked out). Somehow, my name wasn't on the list and in frustration I began dragging the scroll bar up and down frantically hoping that I'd magically see my name; that's when I saw it.\n\nWhen dragging the scroll bar fast enough, I found that the blacked out student ID numbers would temporarily become visible. At first I thought, \"No big deal, what could someone do with a person's ID number.\" Then it hit me. My university uses a web based homework website (WebWork) that initially allows students to access their account by inputting their user ID number as their user name and password. What's worse is that this site NEVER PROMPTS THE STUDENT TO CREATE A NEW PASSWORD. As such, most students never change their password from their student ID number.\n\nRealizing that someone who happened upon this discovery could in turn use it to access other student's homework assignments and tamper with them, I contacted the administrator in charge of assigning lab schedules. In doing so, I not only signed up for a lab group but had them completely remove the ID numbers from the list.\n\nBest part is that nobody in my class will know.

{"prompt":"I understand that people like certain types of music more than others but I don't understand how people can say that some is music is \"superior\" than others. Just because a musician or band is more talented than another doesn't necessarily make them better. Music exists for the purpose of enjoyment so while talent is a factor it doesn't count for much if they can't make it enjoyable to listen to. A lot of people bash on mainstream music and call it crap because most mainstream artists have little to no talent and just keep rehashing the same songs but if people enjoy listening to it, isn't that all that really matters? I personally don't like \"most\" mainstream music (NOT because its mainstream but because it just doesn't appeal to me) but I don't think it's worse than Frederic Chopin or Led Zeppelin (even though I enjoy these two artists far more). If you prefer \"Rx Bandits\" and \"The Mars Volta\" over Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga that's fine but I don't see how you could argue that they're superior because they have more talent.

Minor assault, cheating, lying, stealing, etc. I take what she says with many grains of salt, and I've certainly heard some stories about her, too. But it's always bothered me that my boyfriend tends to like his dad because he's \"cool\" (funny, chill, etc) and sometimes ignores that he's unemployed, lazy, immature... think the archetypal 40-something failure. Apparently he doesn't think the Thanksgiving plan could work out cause his current wife wouldn't like it. \n\nPersonally, I am the type who tells their significant other everything that's going on. As such, it's hard for me to have this (very affecting) information without telling my boyfriend about it.... it almost feels dishonest. But it seems like an awful thing to have on your mind right as you leave for the military... so what should I do?","chosen":"My boyfriend's mom told me that his father is bad news and I don't know if I should tell him the truth about him.","rejected":"Boyfriend's parents disagree on how to handle Thanksgiving, and I'm not sure if I should tell him about it or not."}
{"prompt":"Couple of things:\n\n- I have Bipolar 1 Disorder, I was diagnosed 6 years ago after a severe manic episode\n- About 4 years ago I moved to my current town, went into denial about my condition, got a different psychiatrist and psychologist, and was re-diagnosed with depression and anxiety\n- Also 4 years ago, I met my current fianc\u00e9, let\u2019s call him Jim\n- Life remained fairly unstable but not unmanageable: I was able to focus my attention on videogames most of the time, and it helped that I was getting the depression treated. I did not sleep with anyone but Jim during this time.\n- Roughly 2 months ago I had another very severe manic episode with auditory psychosis. I ran away from the home Jim and I shared, and I did many, many terrible things. I spent most of our savings, ruined my hair, did drugs and abused alcohol, endangered my own life, and worst of all, I slept with 2 people, a man and then a woman.\n\nWords cannot describe how remorseful I feel. Jim and I have since moved back in together; I\u2019ve gotten diagnosed properly and I am now taking the right medication, and we put a safety net in place so that if I run away again, my funds will be frozen and my parents (who are definitely aware of my condition, considering my first manic episode occurred when I was still living with them) will be alerted and will be able to help Jim.\n\nBut the damage is intense. Jim wakes up in the middle of the night and asks me to hold him, because he has nightmares about me running away again and everything falling apart like it did last time. I have nightmares about having another episode too and hurting him again. I feel terrible and I wish that I could help him, but I don\u2019t know how.","chosen":"had a severe episode of bipolar disorder, slept with two people, ran away and hurt my fianc\u00e9.

{"prompt":"So, i was in a not solid relationship with another girl (my family didn't like her that much), but it was fine for me, but then my best friend started to tell me that i should broke up with my gf and start a relationship with her (i wasn't sure if she really meant it)), she told me that her family wanted her to date me (my family also wants it) and we started to talk a lot about this. One week later (2 weeks ago) i broke up with my gf to try to start a relationship with my best friend. We kept talking about her and me, and i was just giving time to ask her out, but then she kissed another guy (not from our city, actually 500km away). The problem is: I know i have to talk to her about my feelings, but i am to afraid to lose her friendship (i know her since i'm 3 years old, she is very special for me), i think i'm in love with her but i don't know if it's reciprocal, what should i do ?","chosen":"i broke up with my gf to try to start a relationship with my best friend, but i don't know if it is reciprocated or not.","rejected":"broke up with my gf, want to start a relationship with my best friend, but i don't know if it's reciprocated."}

I weirdly find myself really accepting of everything. It sounds like most of these were phases in her life and they were centered around one idea or another and she made it clear that that is not the case anymore. Maybe it's not so weird. \n\nI'm considering bringing up the fact that I read the blog but I'm not sure if that is even necessary. The only thing it would do would be to explain why I was so weird today around her.

Mind you, it was immensely tamer and I only mention that because she cut me off in the middle of it and said she didn't want to hear anymore about me because it makes her think of me having sex with other women and she can't deal with that.

She is a self proclaimed commitment phobe, had never been in love, loses interest in guys she dates FAST and is infatuated with Michael. \n\nMichael is a really quiet guy. Up until recently I thought he was a nice enough dude. Whenever we talked previously it was just \"how was your day\" etc. I have noticed however that he has a short temper and tends to say mean comments. For example, a couple of days ago another housemate made a comment about disliking a particular song Michael liked. He paused a bit and then said vehemently \"well then you're just a fucking idiot.\" There was a really awkward pause and everyone got quiet save for a few \"whoa...\"s. Jasmine wasn't present for this. \n\nJasmine has been really into him lately and has been telling me how \"deep\" and sensitive and intelligent he is. How whenever they talk they have such great insightful conversations. She thinks he's different and may be \"the one\" because no other guy has ever made her feel like this before. She's still on the fence about dating him and she says he's the first person she's been actually into for a while. I can tell she's very excited about the prospect of dating him hence my hesitation in telling her my thoughts. She knows he has a temper and says its \"hot.\" \n\nWhat the hell do I do here?

{"prompt":"We met on Tinder a couple months ago and were having nsa hookups for a couple weeks before we realized we couldn't carry on that way, and we either needed to date or get the hell out of dodge. From the beginning I had reservations. We had good sex, but her personality did not endear me to her in any major respect. She was nice, and rather pretty, but I simply wasn't crazy about her. I entered the relationship with no expectations in terms of longevity or stability. My priorities were myself first, and her as long as she wanted to stick around. Maybe it was because we didn't share many interests, came from different socioeconomic classes, or just because my friends didn't really like her, but she almost seemed to annoy me at times. At the same time though, she was really sweet and I couldn't help but smile when I looked at her. My emotions were conflicted in a million ways, and I decided to let the dust settle before doing anything rash.\n\nIt's been almost two months now. We're still together, but I'm finally putting my finger on what my feelings are. Tonight, she mentioned to me that she was at a party last night, got drunk and woke up in the bed of a male friend of hers and he made her breakfast. It was obvious she was trying to make me jealous, because she waited a bit before adding that he slept on the couch and nothing happened. The odd thing is that I realized I didn't care what happened. I just said, \"Oh that was nice of him, babe.\" What went through my mind is, \"I really don't care if you slept with him. Why should it matter to me?\" And that's the heart of the matter. If she cheated on me, I wouldn't emotionally feel a thing. I'd probably break up with her on principle, but I wouldn't feel like I was losing anything. To be clear, though, I also don't feel like I'm being weighed down by the relationship either. *I'm completely indifferent to it.*\n\nIs this normal? Is it a sign that I should just break up? She's also got a lot of little quirks that I find annoying, but I think that's just me being petty and looking for problems.","chosen":"Am emotionally indifferent to my gf, to the point where if I found out she cheated, my reaction would be something along the lines of an apathetic shrug and then I'd almost forget about it.","rejected":"Girlfriend slept with a guy and I don't care."}

I have my little ways of keeping my sanity while working in a very busy restaurant. There are two main things I do: 1) When seating someone, if they pleasantly say something like, \"Would it be possible to get a booth?\" I will probably seat them at a booth, however if they walk in and say, \"There's four of us. We want a booth.\" in a very rude and demanding manner, I will pretend to look at the reservation book and then claim that all the booths are taken and they will have to sit at a table. 2) The restaurant I work in has the option of building your own pizza (you check off all the toppings you'd like and hand in your form to your server) but people rarely read the top of the menu which states that the pizzas start with mozzarella and tomato sauce and often select the option to get extra mozzarella cheese, not realizing it already comes on the pizza. If the table has been pleasant to me, and they checked off mozzarella, I will hand in their form as it is to the kitchen but I will not charge them for the extra cheese on their bill. If they are unpleasant, I will charge them for the cheese. It really doesn't take much.

He walked over to me at the end of the night and gave me less than half of what he owed me. Told me that he would give me the rest of the money soon. Again, gave him the benefit of the doubt and here I am, weeks later with no answer or money.  \n\nI have confronted him in the past few weeks.

{"prompt":"My brother and I will be spending a month backpacking through europe starting in 2 1\/2 weeks and I've been planning to take folding bikes with us, to cut down on taxi\/bus fairs and also just to have the freedom to explore areas we wouldn't otherwise because of the long hikes and time restrictions associated with that. The idea occurred to me as I was visiting chicago a couple months ago and didn't get to see half of what I wanted to see because most of my time was spent walking from place to place. Sometimes places were closed by the time we got there.\n\nI decided on folding bikes because I figure it would be safer to store a bike inside hostels, easier\/cheaper to pack on trains and cheaper to actually ship the bikes to europe with us.\n\nSo, experienced travelers: what do you think of this idea?

There was no container but only my nugs mixed up with a pile of leaves for some reason. While we were trying to scoop up all the pot, a group of 4 big guys came up to us and started claiming that the weed is theirs now. Everyone was yelling and arguing at each other. Things escalated really quick that one of the guys on my left (I was crouched down) pulled out a gun and shot me twice: one at my left collarbone and one at the right side of my chest. It felt like someone took a sledgehammer and just hit me the hardest he\/she could. My vision changed to black + white and I felt something was draining all my energy so I just laid down.

{"prompt":"Here's mine:\n\nI worked as a gas station attendant a couple of years ago. It was a self-serve one so all I did was work the cash, stock the shelves, clean garbage, etc. I had been working at the gas station for just under three months and I was rocking it there. I was top seller for car washes for the last two months in a row, and I completed most of the chores my coworkers didn't feel like doing since I was the new guy.\n\nThis was fine with me, I was just happy to have a job so close to home. However, one day, the manager came in and asked me to go out and clean and repair the car wash. In the short time I had been there, I had learned how the system worked, so I was kind of handy when it came to fixing the machines. Only thing was, this was in the summer and we were in the middle of a major heat wave. I didn't complain though, I just went out and did it. It wasn't very busy and so my other coworker was able to take over the cash register. (I should note that we usually worked in pairs at this gas station). \n\nI came back after about an hour of cleaning the entire car wash area and repairing some of the broken hoses, drenched in sweat. Once back in the store, I saw the manager's son, who I knew quite well since he visited the place often. He was in work uniform, standing at my cash register. I asked what was going on and the manager simply told me that I was not up to their standards and since it was within the \"three month probation period\" they could fire me for any reason they pleased without warning. She asked me to leave.","chosen":"Fired from gas station after cleaning and fixing car wash in sweltering heat, came back to find the manager had hired her son to replace me.","rejected":"Was a gas station attendant, went out to clean a car wash, came back soaked in sweat and manager told me I was not up to their standards."}
{"prompt":"I don't know if this is serious enough to post in this subreddit, so excuse me if you find it trivial...\n\nAbout 3 years ago I found a very kind, funny and pretty girl on the internet. I'm 22, she is near 28. We are chatting regularly, though I noticed that she rarely initiates the conversation - I am almost always first. We are always talking very comfortable from both sides.\n\nWe try to neutralize lack of physical contact by exchanging pictures. It quickly went from clothed face shots to naked photos of \"important parts\". I have some definitely not minor shyness issues, but I overcame them for the sake of photos.\n\nBut lately, she asked me for a rather weird thing - she wants me to make a video of myself in the shower. I instantly thought that it's not going to happen. I am 100% sure it will look very awkward, besides my shyness and my \"constant pokerface syndrome\".\n\nShe insist that it takes no time, it's easy to do, and doesn't require any posing and similar things. I tell her that I'm uncomfortable with that, and suggest that I take usual private places pictures instead. She is then confused how is it possible that I'm okay with sending pictures of my dick, but uncomfortable with sending a video of me showering, with face and everything else visible. Maybe it's a fair point, and I can't really explain it.\n\nOne of her another arguments is that even if I think the video will look stupid or awkward, she will enjoy it. It doesn't really help me in making a decision. In fact, I really don't want to do that, and I suspect that she thinks she somehow deserves that. (Extra info - she didn't say she will make similar video later, but I didn't suggest it either) Communication is one of the most important things in a relationship, but she seems like she doesn't understand it, and insists me to make the vid even if it's uncomfortable for me.\n\nWhat to do?

Either way, I really like him. I'm just not certain he likes me enough.\n\nI always feel it to be a bit of a struggle to arrange a meet up with him. Mind, he's the one to suggest a place and time maybe 1\/3 - half of the time, but he seems to do it in a hastily manner and often he will cancel because he forgot he actually already made plans at the time he suggested. I know this is a red flag and I'm very aware that if he doesn't step up his game, he's just not that into me. But I want to give him a chance, as I know he's brand new to relationships and probably just isn't used to having to spend so much time on a different person + a lack of planning skills.

I'm highly interested in the country's conversations over different topics but one of the conversations has me highly alarmed.\n\nA few years ago, I could walk around town and see people from my town. Notice their new hair cuts, change of style, maybe they got taller. I just saw THEM as the person they are. I saw police officers and would tip my hat to them because they are doing the civil duties for our city keeping us safe.

A person did the illegal act, and another person was the victim. \n\nNow, the view is different. It wasn't a PERSON. It was a BLACK person, or it was a WHITE person. It was a MUSLIM person, a CHRISTIAN person. These labels are defining these individuals in a way that is supposed to generalize this person to a race or religion. The actions of one person does NOT apply to the actions of a whole community or any type of generalization that you may try to associate a person to. \n\nThis rambling all started with me passing a man being pulled over by a police officer on the interstate.

Then I see the police officer walk out of his car. A white police officer. I could imagine his fear as he was approaching a black man, again for the same reason. All of the media covering the senseless killings of police officers by black men. It just gives me a sickening feeling to know that a few years ago, this scene would have been nothing.

{"prompt":"So about 6 months ago my girlfriend said she needed to take a break and a step back from things. At that point we had been together 18 months. She had a new job and her manager always seemed a little shady when it came to texting her. \n\nDuring our break she admitted to sleeping with her manager about a month after we split. She said she never intended for it to happen but it did. Ive always trusted her so i never thought this would happen. About 5 months have passed now and we have been seeing each other again for the past month but nothing is official between us. I was able to look past what happened and move on making things better in our relationship. \n\nDuring our split i also saw someone else a few times, nothing serious but enough for this other girl to become jealous. Tonight she sent me SO a text telling her everything that happened between us and exaggerated things to the point where i stood no chance. \n\nNow i was able to move past what she did because we werent together. She, not so much. She is claiming that i have lied to her and of course now she is saying she is done. I kind of expected for her to not care and be able to move on like i did and make things better in our relationship. I never lied because i was never asked if anything happened and i never said anything because things have been going so well. \n\nShe has told me not to be surprised if i see her out on dates and talking to other guys who want to take her out. So should i just walk away from this altogether? Or should i try to get her to come to accept that i did the same things she had done minus the sex, and realize that it is never going to happen again? I love this girl and i thought we were in such a good place again, walking away from her has never been easy because its not something i can do when it comes to her. \n\nI dont want to give up but maybe its time. Any advice would really be great because right now i feel so lost. \n\nThanks everyone.","chosen":"on a break with gf, we both hooked up with other people. I forgave she wont. What do i do?","rejected":"Girlfriend cheated on me during our break, i was able to move past it because of other things happening and she has been making excuses to go out with guys.

{"prompt":"I've dated my gf for six months now and over that time have really started to fall for her. About three weeks ago she said \"I love you\" and I said it back. However, last night we were in bed and I saw her phone light up and looked though her messages and saw her conversation with an ex bf. She was talking shit about me, making fun of our sex life. A couple days ago we went to Disney and while we were there she texted him saying she wished she was there with him. She also said \"I love you\" to this guy and even asked for a nude pic. I woke her up and confronted her about it and she was really apologetic and said that she did have feelings for this guy but he lived in England and has a serious gf and they're not serious about their relationship they just flirt a lot.  \n\nThis girl was the first girl I've ever exchanged \"I love you\" with but now it feels meaningless because she's saying it to someone else too. She said that she will completely stop talking to this guy if that is what I want, I said I need a day or so to think about things. I really do feel strongly about her but now I feel like I could never truly trust her and that this problem will only get worse as time goes on. \n\nAm I overreacting?

{"prompt":"I moved away to attend art school in a city where I had no friends or aquantinces.  After 3 years of frustrating myself under the impression that I had the passion for visual art I quit school and decided to move on, inspired by a then-freshly developing relationship with a young lady.  I had a few friends at school but lost touch with them as they either left the city or our common interest dissolved.  Since then I had taken up a 9-5 and spent my time devoted to writing music\/selling records\/mp3s and the aforementioned young lady.  At the time I was feeling pretty satisfied and didn't really see a need to socialize outside of that. It was a pretty intimate relationship that I took seriously and to this day I'm lost to understand how things went so awry.  After about a year she decided our romantic interests no longer met and that we should just be friends, a strategy that has not been copacetic.\n\nDismantled, I struggled to focus my energy on my hobby with some success.  I did an album, I toured internationally, I rubbed shoulders with some pretty high level people in that scene. Made a few friends but they live far away and are quite busy themselves.  Music industries are exploitative, oversaturated, and ruthlessly commercial and that has left me with some doubt about continuing.  Over the course of the last two years my inspiration has waned and now I'm left feeling pretty dead and empty now that I no longer have that hobby to distract me.\n\nI've not had much chance to make friends or meet people I connect with over that time, and every friend I've had made has grown apart from me.  I go out semi regularly and socialize but rarely connect with anyone, so far never enough to sustain a friendship or romance. I feel somewhat crippled by the vaccumn of intimacy and social support left by the end of my last serious relationship. After all this time I'm only barely aware of my own personal identity in a social context to even know where to go to meet people with things in common - Reddit included. I'm introverted but not anti-social, and right now I'm at the nadir of a two year rut, and feeling especially lost","chosen":"I moved away from my old friends and she moved away, and now I'm stuck in a rut and feel like I don't know how to move on or meet new people.","rejected":"Moved away and met an old crush, lost contact with her and now feel completely lost in a social context."}

I don't yell or fight him, but I get cold and unforgiving and just quietly tell him the exact things that I know will break his heart. Today he fumbled a compliment, telling me I'm really attractive \"for an Asian girl.\" I told him that was racist, but then I went even further, telling him that I was disappointed in him and had lost respect for him before ditching him to hang out with some other guys. \n\nHe had tears in his eyes as he tried to apologize and I feel bad now. I was cruel to my last boyfriend too, especially when I broke up with him. I think I've learned this kind of behavior from my mother: she always relished having the upper hand.

We talked for a good 30 minutes while my cousin tried to decipher the exchange between me and this girl.\n\nShe was solo-traveling and talked about where she has been to and where she was planning to go. She mentioned that she was from Canada and somehow I brought up weed into the subject. She said she was a huge pothead.. So I guess we had that in common. It wasn't long after that I had to head back out. I think she wanted me to ask for her number but I was too much of a chicken shit to do so.

We began seeing each other regularly while I was in town (4 weeks) and now we communicate via text and phone calls when we can. I am planning on moving to where he lives for a job in two months (planned before I met him).\n\nHe is very kind, genuine and loving. I enjoy talking to him and I see a future with him.

He brought up a two-year move he made when he graduated high school, very nonchalantly, which made me say, \"Oh, was it a mission for a religion?\" since I have met people who have done that, and he said yes actually. We also slept together many times while I was in town. He still texts me sexually natured things. I asked him point blank if he would marry someone that wasn't mormon and he said yes.  \n\nBut then there are things he stays devout about, like not drinking coffee, tea or alcohol, not cursing, he goes to church on sundays, doesn't spend money on sundays. He even will talk crap to me for having a glass of wine sometimes. \n\nIn my opinion, with Mormonism, its one way or the other. You are either all in, or not.

{"prompt":"Me and my fiancee are planning to get married soon, but only recently we decided to talk about money. I am 27 and she is 28. I'm in a solid and secure job as a teacher, and I earn fairly well. She is just beginning her masters degree, and is expecting to get a scholarship soon. If she starts receiving this scholarship, she will earn a little less than 1\/3 of what I earn.\n\nI understand that when you get married, both incomes become the couple's income. But I'm a little upset, and I told her, that she had in mind that we would get married, and she'd only be responsible for part of the expenses, as in I would have to pay for more stuff than her.\n\nShe has this kind of annoying way of creating facts out of small examples. For instance, she mentioned this friend of hers that got married with insecure sources of income, and the marriage is working. Also this other friend, whose salary summed with her husband's salary is not a lot, but things work. In her mind, if two or three couples that she knows are married and (apparently) well, then our marriage is gonna work.\n\nWe went through a list of expenses we would have together, and reached a conclusion that our incomes summed up wouldn't be enough. That's because I would then be responsible for my expenses and her expenses, with just a little financial help of part of her income.\n\nAlthough she acknowledged that I was right about not being able to get married at the moment, she said she was sad, because she would only be able to work in her area after at least two years. She still says that she hasn't changed her mind, and she believes that with our income together, we can work it out. I am worried about our conflicting opinions.\n\nWhat do you think, is it possible to estimate what is a good income to get married? What problems different incomes can bring to the couple? What do you think about the general situation?","chosen":"Me and my fiancee are thinking about getting married, but we have different opinions about marriage and finances.","rejected":"Me and my fiancee disagree on what the correct amount of money should be to get married.

{"prompt":"I've recently open a Roth IRA. My first investment was $4000 into VTI which I feel fine with. Since then I've added an additional $6000 to max it out for the rest of the year. I'm wondering, with a young IRA, how important is diversification? Should I be seeking to fulfill International, Small Cap, and Medium cap areas, bonds, etc.? Would I be just as fine throwing the remaining $6000 into VTI and not worrying about it for a while? \n\nETFs I've been close to pulling the trigger and purchasing are VT, QQQ, VIMSX. I've noticed a trend in a lot of ETFs where during the latter half of the year, theres sometimes a large decline. Is there a preferred time of year to purchase one of these large ETFs or is that possibly in my head? \n\nAlso, what types of things are key to focus on when looking at a stock or a fund? So far my focus has been expense ratios, one year performance, current price obviously, and then lastly the gut feeling I get from other various numbers. I'm sure I'm missing something. \n\nMy situation: I'm 24 years old and currently deployed so I've been trying to do as much research as I could on a slow internet connection. I've ordered several books to help me learn more about investing in the mean time, but the rate of mail delivery out here is criminal. I have a high tolerance for risk at my age. I don't mind maintenance, meaning I don't necessarily want a 'set it and forget it' scenario, however to some exent it would be good for me. I've enjoyed using $2000 to irresponsibly play with, for instance investing in MRVL for a short time, and selling once I received a profit greater than the transaction expenses.

{"prompt":"Hi there, so first things first, I'm from southern ontario and I'm currently in university so my only way to get information on current events is for my mom to tell me, as she is the queen bee of social relations in my family. My mother wants to contest my grandfathers will because she thinks that my grandmother (not her mother) forced him to sign this one without reading it because he was reliant on her care. \n\nIn the will it states that each of his grandchildren will receive 12% of his remaining estate (after taxes and such) but that each of his children will only receive around 1% for being executors on the will. Naturally my mom was pissed, since then she's told me that the grandkids RESP's area actually part of the estate and can be taken to pay taxes, and that all that was left in my grandfathers account was 70-ish dollars (the number always changes when she tells me) despite the fact that he was a millionaire.My mother now believes that my grandmother has taken all the money out of his accounts and left \"us\" with nothing.\n\nHere is the thing,I don't believe her, I think she is going to try and take any money my grandfather left away from me because she didn't get anything from him (despite him paying for her to own two homes and go back to school to get a physics degree). I want to call the lawyer who helped draft the last will before his death (I insisted on getting a copy of the will), will he bill me for the call? How will he bill me for the call if he does, because if it goes into my grandfathers account and my mother finds out I will be entirely screwed.\n\nAside from that, do you guys have any advice on how I go forward? Obviously don't sign anything, but any advice or knowledge you might have would be incredibly appreciated.","chosen":"My millionaire grandfather \"apparently\" left us nothing (according to my mom), I need help finding out if that's true because I think my mother might be trying to take the money that he left me.

I know if she doesnt have feelings for me our friendship might be ruined or at least be a bit awkward but I'm willing to take that risk over sulking on the internet about it forever. \n\nBut the thing is.. I don't know how to ask her out and tell her how i feel. What am i supposed to say? Just telling it to her straight forward sounds a bit... silly.

{"prompt":"I had been in a long distance relationship with a man in Australia (I am in the US) for about a month. The relationship didn't last long because it became toxic extremely quick. Constant fighting, mental abuse from both ends, and it was all around just a terrible experience. It was turning both of us into bad people and I wanted out of it, which I made abundantly clear to him. \n\nDuring our relationship we both said nasty, inhumane things to each other. In the heat of the argument I had told him to just go off himself, this has happened a couple times. I know it's extremely wrong to say stuff like that, but that's how toxic the relationship was. This brings the story to him threatening me with legal action.\n\nHim and his family have been stalking my family, trying to find out my parents contact information and social media profiles to contact them about how bad of a person their daughter is. He has been contacting my friends, harassing them about our relationship. Both him and his dad keep harassing me, telling me how it is illegal to tell people to kill themselves and that they're going to contact the FBI or whatever. This is all extremely childish in my eyes and I'm not quite sure what to make of it.\n\nI have tried blocking him on any form of social media, but he's constantly making new accounts or harassing my friends into speaking to me, which is just so he can threaten me with this legal action bullshit. I have made it so clear to him that I want him out of my life without these complications. I don't know where to go from here because I'm genuinely worried he might make this into a bigger mess than it needs to be.","chosen":"Ex-boyfriend is threatening me with legal action because I was mean to him.

{"prompt":"I'm 22 years old, and a female. I'm short. And I look around 14-15 years old.\n\nThis is not a source of pride, and it is commented on in almost every social situation I encounter, to the point that I don't like meeting new people because I know that they will at some point tell me that they thought I was 15 (or 12 as a 'joke'). \n\nIt's not funny, it's not original. Imagine if every fat person you met you said, \"Wow, I thought you weighed at least 300lbs!\" You would never do that, because it is a shitty thing to say to another human being.\n\nIt does not make me feel attractive, or good about myself. As soon as I produce my I.D. or say my age I stand on the brink bracing myself for a comment, and then I typically go home and think of ways to make myself look older or try to use make up to change the way my face inherently looks. And saying \"You will look great when you are older!\" isn't comforting, because I would rather be able to enjoy my twenties and not looked at like the kid who is too young to be at the bar. \n\nAnd besides that, it makes me feel like I will never find someone who loves me now that I am older than 20. Every relationship seems creepy because every encounter with a new person\/perspective mate starts with, \"I thought you were 15.\" So... any potential relationship is formed with the knowledge that they think I am 7-8 years younger than them? Sweet.","chosen":"Even if you think that someone looks young, don't say it to them. Anyone, male or female.

Jobs, hanging out with friends, being in 1 apartment for more than a year...down to what I'm going to buy for groceries next week.\n\nRecently, I got married which is a really great thing, since it's awesome to share life experiences with another like-minded carbon unit (3 yr relationship, 4 mo marriage). I didn't think would spike the commitment monster given that A) we didn't have a wedding and B) eloped in the mountains to make it as low-key as possible...but it has and I find myself flipping out emotionally over simple, stupid things. I hate it, and I lack healthcare so therapy is not an expense I can afford.\n\nLike, I want to continue cultivating an awesome relationship with this person, buy a house and get a dog or three but my irrational fear of commitment, or whatever it is, is throwing a wrench in the gears of awesome adultyness.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated, especially from folks who have btdt, yanno?","chosen":"fear of commitment is wrecking my life and I need help getting over it.","rejected":"How do I stop myself from freaking out about commitment?"}
{"prompt":"So I don't want to go into a long winded explanation but the guy (21M) I'm (30F) currently dating, I have known for about a year. We started out as friends. Only in the past few weeks did we transition into something romantic. He's cute, smart, and most importantly funny. He has never been in a relationship before so he's pretty much going into this blindly. I don't mind holding his hand during the way because I've had experience with dating someone for a few years that was inexperienced in the relationship department as well. \n\nThe ultimate problem is this... He loves my personality, thinks I'm awesome, beautiful and all that but it bothers him that I am considerably shorter than him, that I am sensitive\/emotional to things, and my age.  He tells me not to be so self conscious about these things but I can't help have that nagging feeling in the back of my head that things will not work out because of these three particular things. \n\nNow the whole sensitive\/emotional thing I'm throwing out the window because I'm chalking it up to him not experiencing what being with a woman who is not a friend is like. I am more sensitive to certain jokes because the fact of the matter is... I am now his GF and some things just aren't appropriate any more to make a laughing matter. \n\nThe rest (age and height) is something I obviously can't help. So basically, what do you guys think? Can this work out in the long run? I know he says not to make a big deal out of it but sh*t does happen and I'm trying to just protect myself here.

It\u2019s like three clubs in one- one side is a bar, one is a dance club and the other has \u201clive performances\u201d (strippers and local bands).They e-mailed me back immediately and said they had openings in the strip club for waitresses and bartenders.\n\nI\u2019m not in any position to turn down a paying job so I asked how I would go about applying. I'm young, I don't mind wearing skimpy clothes and the tips are great. I received an e-mail back asking when I could come in for an interview. I told them I was available whenever and they asked me to stop by the clubs that evening.\n\nI met the owner in the bar and he asked me a few questions before saying \u201cWhen can you start?\u201d. I told him \u201cUh, this week? I can work Wednesdays and Thursdays, along with every second weekend starting after May long weekend\u201d and he said \u201cOkay sounds good\u201d. He then asked for my phone number and said he would give me a text before my start date with everything I needed to bring.\n\nI \u201cinterviewed\u201d on Friday and it\u2019s now Monday.

{"prompt":"So at this bar I frequent, a rather tall and lanky fellow claims to be a US Marine. Coming from a bit of a military family, I was naturally excited to talk to the guy. I asked him what his unit was and he simply brushed the question aside and exclaimed he was at Fallujah and in Afghanistan as though I attacked his credibility. Gave rise to a little suspicion but whatever. Later, I find this guy is telling the bartender he is US Navy Special Forces.

{"prompt":"Here's a little context to our relationship:\nWe started dating about 5 months ago, everything seems great, there are a little problems, mainly that we don't get to enjoy each other as often as we'd like, and he does complain about it frequently.\n\nMy main reason for concern is the following:\n\nAbout two days ago my boyfriend and I were getting ready to go out from my apartment, he was packing up some of his clothes seeing as we didn't plan on returning that very night. Everything seemed fine, we had a great day full of wonderful sex and had a lot of fun together. But as I walk in to the room he hands me a clearly used condom and asks me to dispose of it. Of course, like anyone would be, I'm startled and speechless. He gives me this weird, sort of half-assed smile (the one he usually gives me when he's lying) and asks \"What?\". We hadn't used a condom in a while (I'm on birth control), so I'm clearly upset. He tells me it was a practical joke that he wanted to play on his best friend, and that he filled it up with hand lotion... and salt. I know at this point he's clearly lying and trying to cover something up. Then a couple minutes later when I tell him that there's a clear reason for why I'm upset, as anyone would be. He then tells me that he had jacked off in it and that if he was cheating on me why would he give me the used condom. His argument made sense, but then again I was wondering if he gave it to me because he was worried I'd find it or something along those lines. \n\nI'm scared to talk to him about it and at this point I have no idea what to do. Could he be lying or am I actually just overreacting to the whole situation.","chosen":"boyfriend of 5 months gave me used condom as a subtle joke, claims it was jacked off in it, could be lying or overreacting.

{"prompt":"Ever since I hit puberty (when I was about nine), my mom has always incessantly reminded me to be modest, especially whenever my brothers or dad are around (they got divorced a few years ago, now I have a step dad). The thing is, I'm not \"immodest\". I don't walk around half naked, and I am never dressed as what seem people would refer to as slutty. Since I was nine years old, she has requested that I change into clothes in the bathroom after showering (instead of walking to my room in a towel), that I wear a bra (even if I'm wearing a big t shirt), and that I wear shorts that do not show too much. I'm so tired of it. When I was a kid and starting to physically mature, she told me that my brothers could have \"impure thoughts\" about me so I should be \"modest to protect them\".   \n\nI'm currently living with my mom and her husband this summer, but I return back to college in the fall. Almost every day she asks me to put more clothes on, wear longer shorts, etc. It might be important to note that she's religious, but not *that* religious. I've always had boyfriends and she's never been too strict on anything, besides this. I'm tired of her referencing to my body as if it's something \"unholy\" that should be covered from my fucking FAMILY. I'm relatively attractive (?), but even so, that doesn't mean that my brothers think about me in a sexual manner? I don't know. I had a terrible self esteem growing up, and I think it's seriously messed up the way I view myself and others.   \n\nSo how do I talk to her about this?

{"prompt":"Hi guys, I wasn't sure where to post this so I hope this is the right place. Feel free to ask questions and I'll get back to you.\n\nI am a student in London and 5 of us have found a place to live, we moved in last week but there are lots of problems and we are finding it stressful to sort out while having to study at the same time. There are **3 main issues.**\n\nFirst the **House:**\nWe were told that we would have 3 beds, and got 2. \nThere is no shower installed just a bathtub. \nThe gas bills are extraordinarily high, we switched off the radiators in the house and are still spending roughly \u00a33-5 a day. \nMy bedroom doesn't have a lock or a doorknob.\nThe bathrooms don't have locks either.\n\nSecondly the **Landlady.**\nThe Landlady is terrible, I know that much. \nShe left nearly ALL her possessions behind making it almost impossible for us to move in, I actually had to go home on the day of supposed arrival as I didn't have a bed and it was a complete mess. She promised to clean up by Sunday last week (8 days ago) and nothing. She also promised to install a shower by Tuesday last week and nothing. She gets angry when we call her and rejects us. She even came in without our permission and took some CDs home without clearing up all of the mess. She has even gone to threaten us about the place being a mess (not our fault but hers) and said she'd refund us and move back in but I don't know if that still stands.\nThe day of moving in I had to wait an hour for her to arrive when she should have already been in clearing out the place. She said she only knew 24 hours earlier we would be moving in.\n\nThirdly the **Agents.**\nThey have been terrible, they weren't on time for appointments and tried to sell us insurance which we already have. Now we've moved it's not their problem any more but it is clear the agents and landlady didn't communicate with each other enough prior to our arrival.\n\nMy problem is, what do we do?","chosen":"House is crap, Landlady is terrible, and the agents are terrible. We live in London and I'm having trouble finding a place to live.","rejected":"5 of us want to move in, Landlady is terrible, Landlady is unaware of the date of our move in, Landlady refuses to give us keys, our rooms are a mess and we still have to pay \u00a33-5 a day for bills etc. What do we do."}

Also on mobile typing as fast as I can so I apologize in advance for grammatical errors.\n\nOk, I'm 17 and my bestfriend(male) of 6 years is going to be having a son soon. Throughout the school year everyone had suspicions that his girlfriend was pregnant but we all just dismissed it as her gaining weight.

I have an interview for Monday, the only problem is, i'm supposed to start my new job on Tuesday.\n\nIf I get this agency gig that I have an interview for, I would honestly take that over anything.

I had feelings for someone else within the last year, and I fucked up by constantly seeing that person even though my girlfriend was very understanding of it. She just wanted to get to know her, and would constantly tell me \"a crush is a crush\" and \"a crush is normal as long as you don't do anything inappropriate\". She was the most understanding person, and honest to god the nicest girl anyone has ever met. My family loved her and I loved her family. Our parents got along, and we even had the same circle of friends. For the longest time I treated her like shit, and I am so ashamed to admit to it. I would be very mean to her verbally, and I would bring her down constantly because I felt so much better after it. It's a shit thing to do, but I hated myself and I was jealous of her drive. She's not only a beautiful person on the outside, but she was so sweet and caring to me. She would make sure everything was okay with me before she checked in with her self. And I constantly took that for granted. She put up with me even after I cheated on her, and I would constantly lie to her. Sad thing about all of this was she knew I did it and would confront me all the time. While we were together I kept telling myself she was a nag, and she would smother me too much. That I just needed something different in my life... \n\nI tried dating that girl I liked after my girlfriend and I broke up and things fell through.

{"prompt":"So, both of us are working several hours away from our apartment for the summer, and neither of us will be there, except perhaps to visit a few times.  I recently overheard him talking to his girlfriend about someone staying in his room, and from what I could piece together, his girlfriend's friend may be staying in our place over the summer.  He never mentioned any of this to me, and if someone will be subletting, then it kind of changes my plans for the summer, as I was going to leave some valuables and stuff there which I wouldn't exactly want a stranger using or being around when I'm not there.\n\nWe're only a couple weeks away from the summer, so if he was planning on subleasing, I would think he'd have told me by now.  All I can think is that he's trying to do it behind my back and have his half of the rent taken care of while I'm paying the other half.  Is this normal?  I would've thought that if our place was being subleased in the summer, the subleaser would pay half the rent and we'd split the other half.  Is that wrong?  I don't really know what the standard is.  The utility bills are in my name and I get the statements, so I'm not sure how that would all work out.\n\nEither way, it would seem inconsiderate for him to have a stranger live in our place without consulting me, right?

He doesn't take pleasure in pleasure, he just approaches it the way he would a job.

I kept running, and pulling down leaves, in hopes that I'd trip up the beast. I could feel it getting closer, and I found myself being overcome by waves of nausea as its rancid breath washed over me.

{"prompt":"This morning i woke up to a scuffle in my hermit crab tank. It seemed that they were in a fight of some sorts. The larger of the two, Noodle, had buried itself in the sand over a week ago. Im pretty sure this is normal crab behavior when they are about to shed their skin. So anyways, Kiwi, the smaller one, seemed to have dug Noodle out of its hole and it looke like it was trying to pull a very pink and sad-looking Noodle from its shell. I immediately reached in and pulled Kiwi out of the tank and had my mom keep an eye on him. Then i got a few pictures and a video recording of Noodle walking around the tank without a shell, and i was worried, so i put new food and water in there as well (the banana slices i left in there a few nights ago were now brown and squishy, and the water had evaporated overnight because it is in the triple digits here and we currently don't have air conditioning). I pulled the old exoskeleton out of the sand, scooted the bigger shell closer to Noodle, and watched it crawl in.

He would say how he hoped they could be together one day, how much he misses her, she said that he's one of the few people that she feels she can talk to and feels comfortable with.\n\nFor full disclosure, we had a problem a few months back that I was chatting explicitly to other women via social media and it almost caused the end of our relationship. I'm not proud of it, and I'm doing everything I can to make it right.\n\nSo what do I do? I haven't confronted her as she's more than entitled to have a friend I don't know about and speak to them in confidence. Should I be worried? Maybe she's trying to get back at me?\n\nLet me know what you think.

{"prompt":"Let me start by saying... I know AskReddit has been flooded lately, so if my post is better off somewhere else, please point me in the right direction :)\n\n**Background Info:**\nBefore I was born, one of my aunts got in an argument with my grandparents, and basically alienated her husband and children from the rest of her family.  Therefore, even though she lives about 30 minutes away, my cousins and I have only ever SEEN my aunt at my grandma's funeral.  We actually didn't' even realize she existed until a few years ago when our grandma told us the story.  \n\n**Fast forward to about 5 days ago:**  \nI found out that my aunt is dying of stage 4 cancer that is affecting her uterus, intestine, liver, and lung(s).  Yesterday they moved her to a Hospice house, and are now making her as comfortable as possible.  \n\n**My conflict with the situation:**   \nYes, I feel awful that my aunt is suffering the way that she is and want nothing more than for her to get better, or at least feel as comfortable as possible.  My dad (her brother) is understanding of the situation as he too was alienated from her life, but would like me to visit her at least once.  My mom is trying the guilt trip to get me to go and is quite honestly just aggravating me.  \nI know the right thing is to go visit her (and I more than likely will), but I feel so uncomfortable at the thought of that.  It's hard to put aside the fact that she hasn't cared that I'm alive for the past 21 years.  I just don't want my hospital visit to turn in to a sappy, \"I'm sorry I wasn't part of your life\" scenario.  \n\nIf anyone has had a similar situation, how did you become comfortable with it, or not?

{"prompt":"My boyfriend and I [F, 19 and M,22] have been together for nearly 6 months. We had an intensely fiery start to our relationship, and have been very deeply in love.

We would make a perfect long-term couple, and we've discussed this.\n\nRecently though, things haven't been going as well as I'd hoped, and we officially admitted today the problem:\nHe likes to tease. I don't. \n\nIt's just me, I've always been sensitive to teasing. When someone says \"oh well that's just cause you're stupid :p\", I laugh, but inside my heart breaks a little. Every. Single.

{"prompt":"I have only been dating this girl two months, though I've known her for the last eight months as we used to be coworkers, and I could tell our affection for each other surpassed what I had experienced in the honeymoon phase of my past relationships.\n\nThings had been going great, no fights or arguments at all, aside from her parents not liking me in the slightest. I came over to her house yesterday since I'm helping her train, she's in fantastic shape but she needs someone there to time her workouts, and she casually mentioned to me that she went to HR to request a transfer to a Seattle area hospital that's under the corporate umbrella...we both live in PA. This, of course, blindsided me and distracted me for the rest of night and genuinely made me upset because I've essentially fallen for this girl.\n\nShe decided to sleep at my place and asked me what was bothering me since she could tell I was off. I told her that the Seattle thing caught me off guard and that even though we've only been dating a couple months I'd really miss her once she left. She then says, \"I was hoping you'd come with me\". She had even looked up jobs in my field and said I would be better paid out west and there were plenty of jobs available. I'm currently a grad student, but it's not an issue because all my courses are online, and this move wouldn't be until January or February so who knows where her and I will be at that phase...but this seems like a long term relationship in the making and I'd hate to lose her. \n\nThe problem is, I'm from Philly, I was only in rural PA for work post-college and was looking forward to returning before this girl walked into my life. I have many life long friends and all my family in Philly who I haven't seen in over a year, and I've come to miss the familiarity of it all.

I could not believe that even after having all of their belongings stolen just weeks before they still did not learn their lesson. I see Buddy #1's laptop computer sitting on the couch in plain sight right when you walk in the house. So I decide to hide his computer in his t-shirt drawer in his bedroom and throw the couch cushions off the couch all across the room. (I told Buddy #1 I was doing this just so at least one of them would know that it was a staged robbery. Buddy #2 is the one worse about locking the doors so he is really the one I wanted to teach the lesson to.

He then calls me and tells me about how he got robbed again and I tell him that it was all me and I just staged it to teach him to learn to lock his doors. I had no idea he would call the cops before telling his roommate or myself. He quickly called the cops back to tell them it was a prank and to not send a squad car, but the cop was already pulling up to the house so it was too late to cancel.

{"prompt":"Please excuse the wall of text. Im on mobile. To start, the relationship didn't end on bad terms, but she refused to talk to me afterward. The only explanation she ever gave was that there was nothing wrong with me, but that she needed some time to figure out what she wanted. She was my first REAL relationship, meaning that she was the first girl I'd ever dated that I truly cared about. Of course, she and I lost our virginities to each other, and we were very comfortable together. Now, soon after the breakup I was told I had ADHD and was put on adderall. I'm fairly certain I'm suffering from depression as a result of the break up and the adderall. I looked up some of the mental\/emotional effects of ADHD, and I found that its common for people who have it to, deep down, just want to be loved for who they are despite their flaws. That pretty much hits the nail on the head for me, and it makes matters worse because I haven't been happy, nor have I felt like I have a purpose since I was with her, and I haven't found a girl that I really even wanted to date since then. Now I have tried to get over it and move on, but I end up breaking down at some point. I don't know why I can't move on, and I'm afraid that if this continues its going to take over my ability to interact with people, then my sanity.

{"prompt":"withing the past few days, i had received information from an old friend, that my current GF had cheated on me with another much older friend a few months ago.l This information was, shaky, at best, but irregardless I took seriously and wanted to do a little digging. Well last night, while my S\/O was sleeping, i went through her text messages and found some mildly incriminating information. There were no blatant discussions about previous events, nor any talk of betrayal or hatred of me. there was however quite a few \"i love you\" messages here and there for the past few weeks. I regret now not being able to check the dates and to see how far back it went, but considering how much she texts others, it couldn't have been more than a month (while the event as told to me happened much earlier this year) I have made absolutely no moves, no hints, no nothing. last time something like this happened i flew off the handle (Words were said, absolutely no striking or hitting of absolutely any kind) and this time i want a much more calm and collected approach. He will be coming back from the military in a few weeks and will be staying for a month, that's when i will be doing most of my \"sleuthing\" and digging. Again, as slow as i can take it, for i have no true concrete evidence so i don't want this blowing up in my face.

I'm not too sure what he does in regards with his daily cleansing routine but his breath just reeks. I kind of danced around the subject at first, bringing up how I needed to get my teeth cleaned since I go twice a year. I then asked how many times he goes and he told me he's never gone... I didn't want to make him feel bad but on the inside I was pretty grossed out. It wasn't a shocker that his breath was stinking.   \n\nApparently though this isn't too abnormal for him. He also rarely goes to the doctor and hasn't been in probably 7+ years. He claims that all the vitamins he takes helps him stay healthy and that he has no reason to go since he feels fine. \n\nNow I know I can't force him to go but this is starting to become such a turn off that it really does need to be addressed. His teeth have a lot of yellow staining and even with mints, they don't last too long. \n\nThe reason why I haven't approached this topic yet is because I don't want to offend him yet I want him to realize how serious I think he should go. I don't want to be a nagging mother either and since we are new into this relationship, I'm not sure if I should be that upfront soon. Also, once when I asked him to get an STD check, he got upset since he thought I was calling him \"dirty.\" He told me he is still a virgin but I know that some STDs can be passed around through oral sex.

Here recently I took a vacation with some friends and we met up with some cute ladies from our school. I was meeting one for the first time and after ten minutes of chitter-chatter I realized I was fatally attracted to her. I had been in and out of the dating pool for a while and have yet to ever meet a woman that made me fall. I can't believe it happened so quickly. It's almost as everything clicked. \n\nShe hung out in our group the whole week. I turned everything up, was very nice, and made people laugh constantly. I've never tried this hard. Ever. I never made a move, usually I will, but I was scared stiff not wanting to blow it. We ended up on the beach. All of the sudden she got right next to me and leaned her head against my arm. I instantly went blank. I didn't say anything. A few seconds later she made the response I'm cold. So naturally I take my jacked off and give it to her. Right after I gave her my jacket I recieved a high priority phone call and drifted off for a second to chat. \n\nWe later went back up to their room and I never made another move. I stayed for a while, but she seemed distant and ended up spending the rest of the time in her room without even coming out very often. Did I blow this? If so what now.

We've been dating since.\n\nAnyway, for many, many years, I've loved beards. I don't know why, but I just think they look cool, and ever since I started growing facial hair I've been fond of pretty much every aspect of having a beard: The warmth it provides to my face and neck area, the feeling of running my fingers over it, etc. But I digress.\nWhile talking with my girlfriend, she mentioned how she hates beards. I don't blame her for hating beards; I know it's not her fault, just as loving beards isn't my fault. But obviously, there's a conflict here. I have a deep-seated passion for beards and want *so bad* to grow one and have a beard of my very own, and she hates beards and wants me to shave what small, budding beard I've grown thus far. There's no compromising there. Either I give her the finger and grow a beard - not happening, at least not the \"give her the finger\" part, 'cause I'm not an asshole - or I give in and start shaving regularly.\n\nI'll be happy to edit with any more necessary details, so if you need to know anything else, feel free to ask in the comments.

This is probably one of the most kind and supportive subreddits that I have come across.  Everybody here seems to be excited to share any helpful advice. Now, here is where my plea comes in\u2026.  Perhaps posts such as this have been done in the past, but I thought this message could be helpful now.  I've noticed over the past few months a few posts dealing with eating disorders and diets.  Please, if you see a post from someone stating that they have a past or current history of an eating disorder, or notice eating disorder behaviors listed in their post, do not give diet advice!  The only advice that internet strangers should be giving regarding health conditions is to seek professional help :-).  Eating disorders are complex and notoriously hard to treat, they are life consuming, and have the highest mortality rate out of any mental health disorder.  Considering that the diet season is now in full swing, I imagine these posts may become more common.   And please, if you feel that you may have an eating disorder or a dysfunctional relationship with food seek professional help.  There are nutritionists, therapists, and physicians who specialize in eating disorders.  Eating disorders come in all shapes and sizes.  Just because you aren\u2019t as thin as what we may stereotypically think a person with an eating disorder should look like, it doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t need or deserve help!  If your relationship with food or your body cause you a considerable amount of stress, please heed this advice.   There are some great resources online for eating disorders such as:  or   \nANAD also has a helpline for eating disorders:  The ANAD Eating Disorders Helpline 630-577.1330","chosen":"Don't give advice to those struggling with eating disorders or with their body.

{"prompt":"I went on facebook today and saw a picture of a guy I use to like with a girl sitting on his lap; you can tell they're dating, and I just instantly started bursting out crying. What was wrong with me, why didn't he like me, why am I never enough for others? I just hate myself so much, I feel unattractive, lonely, rejected, isolated, fat, and I've felt this way since I was 13. And I hate the world for being so inhumane and cruel, you realize as you get older, life is never like it is made out to be in the movies, TV, or in books. Life feels bleak and not enriching at all. \n\nSo many of my relationships don't stick ,people come in and out of my life all the time, never sticking around. The only friends I have are guys who are nerdy and have very few friends themselves, my friendships with girls are non-existent. \n\nI also have allergies and it makes me feel very uncomfortable most of the time. It's a struggle trying to fight my allergies. Ugh I don't know what to do, my life fucking sucks and I hate myself so much. I am 24; had depression since 13. All I have to say is fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuckkkkkkk. (pardon my language)\n\nMeanwhile, I'm excelling in education, I receive many scholarships, awards, and job offers, I volunteer so much (over 200 hours this year), I know I will have no problem getting into the grad school of my choice, my professors love me and see a lot in me - but my relationships fail so much...I am so unhappy despite it all.... screw you life.

{"prompt":"I've been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend, Jack, since November 2015. Prior to that, we were friends for 6 years. He spent a few days around Christmas back home with his family in his hometown before flying to see me.\n\nLast Christmas morning, he confided in me that \"a lesbian from high school made out with him\", then claimed that he \"stopped it immediately\".\n\nHe was initially very apologetic with lines like \"I don't want to lose you over something I didn't even want\". Despite this, he ended his barrage of messages by saying, \"I'm a little concerned that you're not showing empathy for my pain\". I felt very hurt and betrayed but chose to forgive him because I thought we had a future together. The feeling of doubt never left my mind though, because I didn't think a lesbian, even drunkenly, would \"force themselves\" on someone who she knows has a girlfriend.\n\nEarlier last week during my visit, I found out through his messages that they did sleep together that night. I confronted him and he broke down, with apologies ranging from the classic \"it didn't mean anything\" to \"it was only 10 minutes and not even enjoyable\". He says that I need to learn to forgive and trust him again in order for us to move on. He claims that he didn't tell me about everything that happened because he didn't want me to feel the pain that he's been suffering ever since it happened. Naturally, he also added that it'll never happen again because he can't bear to ever hurt me again.\n\nAlthough it makes the most sense for us to just break up, I can't help but feel that maybe we can move past this with counselling. For the most part, he's a very affectionate and caring boyfriend who's been flying to visit me every 2 months, even once while I recently studied abroad in a country halfway across the world. We just get along so well together. We've since written each other a list of things we love about the other and letters detailing our feelings. I still love him a lot, but I don't know how to bring myself to forgive him for this.","chosen":"Boyfriend cheated 1 month into our relationship, never told me the full story until I found out but claims he was just doing it to protect me.

{"prompt":"A couple of years back myself and a couple of friends were enjoying some late night weekend drinking.

When I finally secured a place at the bar, about to hail the bar steward, only to notice a sharp, digging pain in my left side.

I went to school a little late so I'm several years behind a normal graduate, and am anxious to get on with a real career. Because of this, and because I've found out that the program I was in taught me almost zero marketable career skills, I am applying to an Information Systems graduate program in order to get a background in business intelligence which I think should give me the technical background to do actually apply some of the things I learned during my undergrad. \n\nSo, unfortunately I have been sort of tracked along an accounting\/compliance career path that I have no real interest in due to the nature of my last few internships\/temp gigs I was able to land. I interned for both a decent-sized metropolitan city's accounting\/auditing department, and a non-profit in \"operations and compliance\" (really accounting). Neither translate to much real experience, mostly data entry, and looking over files to verify information accuracy. I did get some work doing legal document review as well. I have no interest in continuing on an accounting or compliance career track, but all the bites I have been getting in my job search are in this field.\n\nFast-forward, I was able to obtain, through a recruiting agency, an interview with a large, very well established and highly reputable investment firm. It's a big deal. Just having their name on my resume will probably guarantee me interviews in the future; however, the role they want me to interview for is in compliance.\n\nMy question is, assuming I am offered a position, whether I should take a job that will track me further in that direction (which, again, I am not ultimately interested in) while I am earning my graduate degree for the next two years. The prestige of having that company's name on my resume would be a huge plus, and the reality is that I'm sure I will learn a lot, but I don't want to end up with another two years behind me, where the skills I'm learning will not balance with my ultimate career goals. \n\n(Maybe this is a good spot for","chosen":"I want to get a job in a field I have no interest in, but I know happening.

{"prompt":"My husband and I have been together for nine years. When we first got together, he was quite critical of my body. He had a criticism for a number of my body parts, but the one that stuck with me the most was his criticism of my weight. At 5'3 and 119lbs, I was \"fat,\" according to him. He would encourage me to work out more to lose the weight. During that time I developed an eating disorder. Bulimia, to be specific.\n\nNine years later, he has apologized for those comments, saying he was young, naive, stupid, etc...  He tells me I am beautiful and that he is very attracted to me.

He is going through some pretty heavy family drama right now, and had a really abusive upbringing. He sees a therapist routinely which helps but has a very distracted and complex headspace. \n\nI'm still trying to understand his personality 100% because sometimes he is very difficult to read.

{"prompt":"I have a good friend, let's call her Alex, who I've known since Christmas last year. We started talking a lot, and we've grown very close since then, I trust her loads and it's really amazing to have someone I'm so comfortable with, who I trust.\n\nThe problem is - when we're off school, which we are now, she very rarely sees me, even though she sees her friends. Last night she went shopping with 5 of them, and today she's gone to another's house, for all the day. I've talked to her, I've let her know I feel a bit hard done by, and she says that she can't do stuff with me really, because she's far too uncomfortable to tell her parents she's meeting me - she can't come hang out with me at mine, because she says they wouldn't let her go on her own. Once that's ruled out, there's not a lot left to do: we can't go shopping together, because she's going twice this week; I can't go to hers, because her dad works from home and mustn't be disturbed. It's freezing out, we can't exactly go for a walk either.\n\nI trust her, I understand fully why she's reluctant to ask her mom if she can come to mine on her own - I don't at all think she's just saying all this shit because she doesn't like me. It isn't nearly as much of a problem when we have school, she can come to mine in the afternoon without her mom knowing and she has a lot of school work so she's quite busy with that too. I'm not saying she needs to drop everything and spend all her life with me but I'd just really love to see her more, she's important to me and it hurts a little to see her and her friends posting on instagram and Facebook about what a good day they had, because I never get to spend time with her like that.\n\nWhat are your thoughts, Reddit?

{"prompt":"Hi Reddit,\n\nThis is my first post on reddit ever, so please excuse me if I'm not doing this correctly.\n\nI met a very nice girl on plenty of fish about 4 months ago. We get a long great and we have both developed feelings for each other. We spend everyday with each other and were both very happy and content with the way things are going. I haven't been in many relationships before and my last one was a long distance relationship which lasted about 6 years so the dynamics of seeing someone on a consistent basis is very new to me.\n\nDuring the first month of my new relationship we abstained from actual sex, we did however mess around and fore play with in the first 2 weeks of being together. After about a month into this relationship we started to have actual sex on a consistent and regular basis, (4-5 times a week). This has been the same up until about 2 weeks ago.\n\nI noticed she seems to not want it as much now, isn't as intimate with me and doesn't seem as interested. I asked her about this and she says she wants sex less for the build up for when we do have it. She assures me this is the only reason why we are having sex less, however she has a high sex drive, but wants to abstain.\n\nSo I'm left a little confused, she has a high sex drive, we had a lot of good sex in the beginning however that has dropped off and now she wants to wait 2-3 days per \"session\" per say. \n\nThe whole scenario is making me slightly insecure because it happened all of a sudden, or seemed too. \n\nWhat I'm trying to ask is - is this a normal thing for a relationship with the information I posted above? I'm posting due to my lack of experience with regular, consistent relationships in terms of sex. Is it normal for the amount of sex you have to slow down a few months in?","chosen":"First relationship with a great girl, we have both developed strong feelings for each other, we've had sex on a consistent basis now, however she seems to want less sex than she used to.

I message back within an hour usually, even when I'm at work. I just think it's polite. But 7 hours? I never mention expecting a reply quicker, or let on that I'm disappointed though. I should point out I was in a LTR for a number of years, and my ex not messaging back for hours was fine because I knew it didn't mean anything - we had a pretty solid relationship.

{"prompt":"My first time posting after reading so many posts for the last few months.. I really would like to get some advice so here I am writing!\n\nI am a 26 year old female. I started my full-time career 3 years ago back in 2012 and worked at this Korean music management company for two years. I loved 70% of my job and I hated the rest of the 30% which involved a lot of bs and politics within the company that really overtook the good sides of the job. I was also being fed up with Kpop scenes so I ended up quitting the job early 2014.\n\nI left Korea right after I quit to try something else. I wasn't doing too well but I definitely enjoyed my time learning and seeing new things in music scenes of N. America. At the end of the day though I was always worried about my visa status and was thinking about leaving and going back to Korea at some point this year.\n\nThis January I got a phone call from my old boss and he offered a position with a raise and promotion. The company was doing a lot better than the time I left so I decided to take it without really trying to know where the company is at and how things are doing now, because I thought I knew the place.\n\nI packed everything early and rushed back here about a few weeks ago and started the job right away. It didn't take 2 days for me to figure out I absolutely hate the job. It's been slightly more than 2 weeks and I got reminded why I had quit in the first place. My boss had to convince a few executives to bring me back - for his convenience obviously -although everyone thought I did a great job before I left. I really don't see my future here, don't want to negotiate my terms because I don't see myself working with these guys long term.

He smokes and chews in hour intervals. He began to get sick a lot in the morning (like shitting this black goo everywhere). He even smokes when he's sitting on my toilet, and i think that's just nasty. When I ask him about it, he says he has anxiety and that's just how he does it, or that his family has always had substance-dependency issues. He won't see a doctor for anxiety or the nasty morning poop thing. Now his breath is always terrible because of smoke and chew, and i don't even want to get close anymore. Now, I've been beginning to notice other things habits about him that really turn me off. He bites his nails and spits them on my carpet, he always has to have a fan and tv on at night, etc.. \nI mean, I know we have our own habits and whatnot, and I know I have my own, but I try to talk to people when I'm stressed and he just seems to turn to his habits, and tune me out.","chosen":"boyfriend's smoking and chewing is gross, he blames anxiety.","rejected":"I'm disgusted by my boyfriend's habits, and I don't know how to talk to him about it."}

I'd had a lot of wine, so I told her she was a cold hearted bitch. (douchey, yes, but I was drunk and hurt.) She took offence (obviously) and we ended up having a long conversation.

But have limited space and time to exercise it due to school (from approx. 8.00-17.00(tops), so, fulltime. \n\nI really look forward to all of your answers, and I will read every single comment and really hope you are able to help me.","chosen":"Really want a companion, live in apartment while in full time school, what breeds would fit\/suit me?","rejected":"I will have more time to exercise my BEAGLE in the future, but will need a breed that can be exercised and still not be extremely destructive."}
{"prompt":"I created a new name just because quite a few people know my usual name and I don't want to start something.  I'll try to keep it short and sweet and see what reddit thinks about it.\n\nI was at a party over the weekend with a bunch of friends and my girlfriend.  This guy who is from work comes around from time to time and isn't much more than an acquaintance to many.  Everyone is relatively friendly with him and he is openly gay.  After quite a few drinks he starts getting a little inappropriate and saying to a couple of my friends\/girlfriend \"oh you all have great tits\".  He then went up to my girlfriend and forcefully grabbed her boobs (pretty hard) and squeezed them.  She slapped his arms hard but he like held on for about 5 seconds and said \"these are amazing\" while feeling them all up and down.  I didn't do or say anything but I had to remove myself from the situation because I was pretty pissed.  My question is, do gay guys think just because they are gay they can pull something like this?  Is it really a big deal because technically they aren't interested?  I am really curious what the straight and gay redditors think\n\nEdit:  I see that this topic was brought up previously.  This is not a repost of the same incident, it's my own experience...but I guess it emphasizes that this isn't just an isolated thing that happened to me.

I have been training with the Olympic coach and for now he has said that we are on the right track to becoming a high level international athlete. But... I feel so lost. Not because of dwindling motivation but I feel like when I'm done with this sport I will have missed so much of my life. I've somewhat put my education on hold. I'm taking online classes to maintain my full funded tuition. I'm seeing my friends graduate and it's getting me worried about what I'm going to do afterwards. I was thinking about applying to a university in this city, but I'm worried about lost credits. I don't want to have to redo 3 years of university.\n\nFinancially, I'm not getting anywhere. I have started to teach Tae Kwon Do, but it's for a boss who pays crumbs and it barely gets me by every month. \"Get a better job?\" I would. But the way the relationship works with my coach\/master\/myself doesn't allow me to. It'd be like turning on my master and the taekwondo family. It's tough. Right now, I'm chasing my passion, but honestly, unless I open my own martial arts school one day (I don't really like teaching) there isn't money in it afterwards.

{"prompt":"So it had been a long day with the wife and I was finally ready to sit on my porcelain throne and relax for a good 15 minutes. Instead of my usual Redditing that I did during my defecation I figured I would clip my finger nails and toe nails to pass the time and clear my mind. Well 10 toes down, things were going great. My toes were looking all sexy again and I was feeling confident for the first time in forever. Something about toe clipping changes a man. Well now I moved on to the fingers. I had positioned myself far back on the seat so there was an open space between the rim of the seat and my pubic area. 4 fingers down and I was feeling great about myself to a greater extent, almost done with one hand. Well, my other hand decided it was jealous and wanted to be a dick. He wasn't patient enough and tried to get his nails clipped sooner by giving the clippers to the other hand. Neither my other hand or I knew this was going to happen and the clipped clumsily fell into the toilet that I had left my waste in. I look down to see my shiny clippers now coated in a brown matter that I had zero motivation to touch. Panicked and with my alone time running out before my wife or kids knocked on the door, I did the only logical thing. I flushed the toilet. I waited and flushed again and now the toilet is overflowing. I admitted what I did to my wife to which she laughed thinking I was kidding, lost her happy gaze when she realized I wasn't, and now won't talk to me until I fix it.","chosen":"Didn't flush my poop, My hand was a dick trying to clip my fingernails, I messed up my toilet by flushing my poop covered nail clippers","rejected":"Clipped my fingers, my other hand tried to get his nails clipped, the clippers fell in the toilet, and now we don't talk to each other."}

I have talked about Kevin a lot to Steve because I met up with Kevin several times to discuss my firm before he started working with me.  \n\nYesterday: Steve was helping me prepare and pin up my presentation in our graduate gallery. I was fairly stressed about it not coming out well. Kevin was also there. We interacted for about 10 minutes pinning up and due to my stress and my own personal social awkwardness, I neglected to introduce Kevin to my boyfriend.  As we left I immediately apologized. I could tell I hurt his feelings. When we got home, we didn't talk. (In the past I have learned I need to give him his space when he is upset.

As far as I saw there was nothing very sexual in her messages (just him complementing her on her r\/gonewild posts), but they were very affectionate toward each other. He would say how he hoped they could be together one day, how much he misses her, she said that he's one of the few people that she feels she can talk to and feels comfortable with.\n\nFor full disclosure, we had a problem a few months back that I was chatting explicitly to other women via social media and it almost caused the end of our relationship. I'm not proud of it, and I'm doing everything I can to make it right.\n\nSo what do I do? I haven't confronted her as she's more than entitled to have a friend I don't know about and speak to them in confidence. Should I be worried? Maybe she's trying to get back at me?\n\nLet me know what you think.

{"prompt":"(Fake names) Gonna try to keep this brief. I was pretty much hopeless before this year, anti-social etc yada yada. Decided to clean up my life, become normal. Really wanted to prove something to myself and have a girlfriend, mostly for the sake of it. Got with Sarah, who I've been with for six months exactly. I can't really say that at any point I've felt that much for her, I was more in love with having a gf than my gf. \n\nBoth of us have noticed this since then. It's pretty clear that she really likes me and wants this to succeed. I can't open up to her or find that spark in her that resonates with me while she's opening up her heart. We've talked once before about maybe ending it and how we'd try to be closer and that's where we left it, and again much more seriously yesterday, where she pointed out how I've been preferring the company my bff of two years, Lily, to hers for a while, now. \n\nI really didn't notice this, but I'm thinking more and more about it and... Well, I'm falling for my Lily. And in my talk with Sarah yesterday she brought up how apparently Lily's had something for me for basically forever, which I've also been oblivious to. \n\nNow, facing my feelings, I'd really like to be with Lily. I didn't mean for things to end up like this, but I don't know how to break any of this to Sarah.

Now, I've noticed that within the last 10 months or so our passion in the bedroom has burned down to its last embers. We've both had our fair share of low times and we've both managed to pick each other up and move through it. But his libido has never really return to the full ferocity it once was. Lately I've given up even asking because to be quite honest, my self esteem has taken quite a blow from his constant rejection. I hint though, oh boy do I leave hints. But he would rather unwind after work by playing Destiny until the early hours. If that's how he wants to unwind, that's fine by me. But every day? I mean, how much of that game does he still have to discover??\n\nWe've talked about this subject before and he always gets quiet and withdrawn and says that it's not me it's him. And then seems upset that I'd even ask him about it, so I don't ask him anymore. I don't want to upset him, but how can I talk to him about this? I'm partial to tricking him into an evening of steamy, passionate, semi-rough sex, no matter how unethical it may seem.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this far in! This is my first post to reddit (literally signed up about 15mins ago).\n\nAlso I really should add that I'm not going to be tricking him into unethical \"surprise sex\" or anything else!!\n\nThank you!!

My girlfriend was let go without repercussions. \nAfter riding in the police cruiser in front of a big, loud, scary dog, the officer brought me in to see my parents. I was VERY baked and my anxiety was in full swing. Manic screaming, crying, hyperventilating, etc. The officer went through my bag and found medical marijuana bags. I had taken these bags from my friend (Let's call him Dave) because I needed something to put my crutches, roaches and kief in and they didn't have any plastic bags.

This is not true. I only had the bags because I needed them for storage. I had already given them the name of my actual dealer.

Me--not having internet at the moment, or really any thoughts about how to get another place at 6pm at night on the coast, went with the 1 bedroom.

I would understand a holding fee, but paying $350 just to hold a spot is utterly ridiculous. I've done the math, and by the time I do get the full $700 or so, it would be time for next month's rent, which would add another $350 on top of that.

At that point my motivation was pretty low, and I ceased to text her for a month.\n\nRecently after a month of not texting, she texted me first saying hey and asking me how I was doing and we talked a bit about how we were preparing for school. She actually explicitly asked me that we should both get a coffee together at school and I expedited it by suggesting that we should go to our university's kickoff game. She said yes and that it'd be a new thing for her to try but later that night, she said she couldn't go because she had to work an on call shift. (She's a high school tutor so it's busy season now). I totally understood and wasn't blown off by her cancelling, but by the fact that she never makes alternative arrangements and therefore leaves us in a limbo again.\n\nSince I've known her for 30 seconds in person, I'm not emotionally attached, but I would like to give this girl a genuine shot IRL before writing it off and moving on. Should I cut my losses, tell her I'm not content with our interactions being limited to social media or wait for her to start something? Or any other suggestions? My friend says this girl is leading me on and using me for attention and once she gets her fix she bails.\n\nThanks Reddit!","chosen":"Long term relationship with girl, not emotionally attached but I want to give her a chance before moving on.","rejected":"How do I break up with a girl and proceed from there?"}

We'd meet for coffee between our shifts at work and talk a lot. In November I admitted to him in a drunken stupor that it bothered me that of all the men I know, he's the only one I can't fully tell if they're attracted to me or not. He wasn't entirely sober either, and said that he was attracted to me, but in a sexual way, not a relationship way.\nI figured whatever, and let that go.

I did not respond as I felt that there was immense tension since Sarah avoided any contact with Matt since he would continually stalk her.  Over the months, she was getting bombarded with text messages about how he loves her or that he threatened to kill he cat.  It was very sporadic in what he was trying to say.  Anyway, I just wanted to avoid getting in between them, so I just focused on one side rather than mediate.  Also, I agreed with her points that the guy had a severe gambling problem (but that's another story).\n\nGetting to the point, I have been invited by another friend (Peter\/29M) to his wedding and Matt is going to be attending.  Not sure if Peter knows about my falling out with Matt, but I intend to go.

Netflix takes a very long time to buffer, so we try to start back up again. For some reason, this time I can't get hard. There's very little awkwardness, though. I just chalk it up to being tired.

{"prompt":"Hey,\n \nMy SO (20m) and I (20f), dating 2 years, have been experiencing a rough patch lately. I've basically felt like I've been putting in the majority of the effort and molding my schedule to his while he does as he pleases for the last few months. Last night I was telling him how I've been feeling really upset by his behaviour lately and it's really starting to weigh down on me. Something that's really been bothering me is I don't think we've spent a saturday night together since this semester began (we're both 3rd year uni). I always ask him to hang out and he says he'll let me know later. I wait and usually get no response until i ask again or until very late, at which point I'm unable to make plans with other people so I end up sitting home alone very sad. I understand everyone needs some alone time but I feel like he's just being selfish now. \n\nBut anyways, after I told him all of this his response to me is that he doesn't value the relationship as much as i do. This broke my heart, and he's acting like it's no big deal. I don't want to be in a relationship with someone that doesn't care about me as much as I do them, and even worse, doesn't see anything wrong with not caring as much. This whole thing has been quite the mindfuck. I don't want this to end, but I don't know how to move on from what he said when he clearly doesn't see that this is a serious problem.\n\nAm i making too big of a deal out of this or do I have a right to be upset? What can I do or say to him to get past this? I'm so lost.","chosen":"BF told me he doesn't value the relationship as much as i do. He doesn't see anything wrong with this. What can i do now?

So here's the problem, just recently we had somebody quit at the camp and they need me to work there more often. Anyways today was one of those days and it just got sprung on me that I had to come in on Thursday. so when I go in on Friday I give one of my managers a heads up that I wont be in the next day because I got called in to work my other job. As I was expecting she got a little pissy and asked me about 5 times if I was sure I couldn't make it in the next day by the end of my shift.

So, doing what I was told I call in and let them know I wouldn't be in an hour before my shift was supposed to start as is standard procedure.

We may hold hands while walking around, but that's as far as it goes. There's no kissing allowed (I'm lucky to get a small peck), and hugs are kept formal (like the weird side-hugs you give friends). She says it's because she's around co-workers and managers and it's unprofessional to be hugging and kissing around them (she's off the clock and out of uniform on her breaks though). Okay fine, whatever. \n\nHowever, the reason this bothers me is because she has a thing for tall, bearded guys with tattoos (who doesn't, right?) and there's plenty to be had there.

The other is a house party with a bunch of other co-workers who kind of know me but have been at the company a bit longer.\n\nSo I've told her that I would think about going to the house party if I can get a ride, and she has basically offered to drive me there tonight. I have yet to respond, because I really just want to do my own thing.

That is also when multiple buildings began being threatened at once as well as when some of our dorms were first targeted.\n\nA fairly up to date list of threats, times, and targets is at [this link.](\n\nThe most recent article posted online with additional info is [here.](\n\nOur campus police are working with the FBI, local law enforcement, US DOJ, and regional Joint Terrorism Task Force are all working on the case and we must have every bomb sniffing dog for 250 miles on call - those dogs are champs!\n\nA student has started a blog to collect information in one spot [here.]  I don't post that though as anything more than a place to find info on when and where each of the threats are, and don't vouch for any of the analysis posted there.  The posts are only covering publicly released information and so are necessarily incomplete.\n\n**QUESTIONS**\n\nI'm not expecting any of you to come up with a solution.  Rather, I'm curious if anyone has stories of similar experiences or knows of other things we might do here. \n\nIn particular, when the dorms were threatened the anxiety among our undergraduates notably elevated.  Rumors of similar threats being made at Virginia Tech before the shootings there have surfaced, but those of of more prone to actually use our google-fu than believe rumors have come up empty when trying to find information on this.  Are we missing something there?  \n\nRelated, do any of you know of instances where repeated threats were used to learn about the police response in advance of something more serious?\n\nThanks for reading and sharing any ideas you have.  Just had our first threats on a weekend earlier this evening and less than an hour after those cleared, we had our first seven building at once threat which is being cleared as I write this.","chosen":"University of Pittsburgh campus has received 35 bomb threats in recent weeks, anything from the hive mind?

{"prompt":"Hi guys,\n\nI'm currently 16 years old, and i've been trying to find a job over the summer to make money and gain experience but have had no luck so far. Recently, a Dunkin' Donuts store near me has had a \"Now Hiring\" sign at their door that says that they're hiring bakers, sandwich makers, and cashiers. I was interested in applying to be a cashier, so I went in last Saturday and asked to speak to the manager about applying. The person who was working there said that the manager wasn't there, but she told me that i'd have to apply online first and then come in to talk to the manager. Later that day, I applied on their website, and I decided to give the manager a few days before I go back. I went back yesterday (6 days after applying online) and asked to see the manager (different employee this time), and the person working took my name and phone number and said that the manager wasn't there but would be there tomorrow until 12pm. Because of this, I waited until today, and I just went in less than an hour ago (around 11:45am) to ask to speak to the manager about applying. The person working (same one who spoke to me yesterday) went in the back and came back and told me that the manager said that she was \"busy\" and that I should call them this Monday sometime between 2pm and 4pm. After that, I just thanked the employee who was helping me and left. \n\nDoes anybody else think this is just an excuse that the manager made up so that she doesn't have to speak to me? I feel like, if the manager really did want to interview me, she would have called me already or came out to talk to me when I was at the store, and the whole \"she is busy\" thing sounds like an excuse. At this point, I feel like I should just not call about the job on Monday and that I should just look elsewhere, but I would just like to get some outside opinions on what other people think about this.","chosen":"I applied to be a cashier at a Dunkin' Donuts, but the manager said I needed to come in to talk to me, and that she was \"busy\" so that I should call them on Monday.

{"prompt":"My wife and I are preparing to apply for a mortgage through a pretty excellent local program. Our credit is good (~690-710), but we're right at the maximum accepted debt to income ratio of 45%. A big chunk of this is a $200 car payment on a loan that is under her parent's name. They bought the car, took out the loan, and have everything registered under their names. We \"bought\" it from them (aka, we agreed to make the payments for them every month).\n\nWhen we're applying for the mortgage, is this considered our debt or her parents? Again, the car is titled, registered, and the loan is held by them. We make the payments and have paid for the insurance.\n\nIf we don't need to claim this, it would make our debt to income percentage look a lot better. I understand that percentage is there for a reason, but we're currently paying a substantial amount more in rent than the mortgage, upkeep, insurance, etc.. would be for the house according to everything we've been able to find, not to mention savings in gas, groceries, and such for moving to a less expensive town.","chosen":"Parents bought a car, we make their payments.

I get along with each of them reasonably well, but I have one office mate that eats food literally all day.

Every gummy bear, every chip, every goddam bite of lasagna is being gobbled up in high quality, 7.1 Bose Surround Sound.

He only seems to talk about himself and he's basically a shell of the guy we both grew to love. Over the past two months he's been getting really sensitive to anything we say (Mary and I are both smartass gingers with extremely strong opinions. Also worth noting, both of us lack the brain-mouth filter so things tend to just come out). He is refusing to admit that he's being overly sensitive and keeps saying that what we say and do are hurtful, even though it's a known fact that we're smartasses who tend to speak then think. \n\nHe's actively refusing to accept that his ex left him and move on, and when both of us approach him about it he gets very defensive when we talk about how both of us were engaged to people who left us. He keeps saying that it's different and that our arguments are invalid. \n\nHow do we, Mary and I, deal with this?

My wife has put me through quite a bit of crap in these years, to include flying the coop and leaving me to raise our son alone for 6 months.  Despite this, I decided to try to give her another chance provided she stay on her medication.  I was sort of hoping maybe she would be less selfish now.... Since she has come back, I've doing very well financially (new job, big raise yay), so I purchased a very nice new home and I like to keep it that way.  She decides she wants a cat, I tell her over and over I do not want a cat.  What does she do?  She gets one anyway.  I did my best to tolerate it, but I can't stand it.

To make matters worse, I know he is very self-conscious and can be quite jealous, which I suspect is why he is very private about their relationship towards me because he knows I have a thing for her.

{"prompt":"Back in October, I started a new job and there was this guy I found very attractive. I hit on him relentlessly which caused a friendship to form. We'd meet for coffee between our shifts at work and talk a lot. In November I admitted to him in a drunken stupor that it bothered me that of all the men I know, he's the only one I can't fully tell if they're attracted to me or not. He wasn't entirely sober either, and said that he was attracted to me, but in a sexual way, not a relationship way.\nI figured whatever, and let that go. A few weeks after that, he and I ended up hanging out outside of work and hooking up. That then turned into a regular thing where we'd hang out at least once a week.

Then eventually it turned into my going over after work and we'd just talk, watch tv\/netflix, and sleep, with an occasional sexytime. \nNow, it seems that he and I talk more than anybody else I talk to, and I know I'm who he talks to most too.

This was absolutely not true. I assured him of this and he seemed to already know. My stepdad can be a bit uptight, but he has a huge heart and would never have done such a thing.

I'm afraid of going on a huge rant here, but I'm not very stable emotionally speaking, and when I'm down she *never* tried to cheer me up. She has said that's she's there for me 24\/7, but she really, really isn't. Far from it. I feel unappreciated and worthless when speaking to her, but I can't let go anyway... It's ironic that I call her my next-best friend; that might tell you, my dear reader, a little bit about me. I've never had a lot of friends and I guess that's the main reason I am so anxious about losing one of the few people I did managed to befriend.\n\nI've not posted here before, and I really am not sure if I got all the info you guys need.

{"prompt":"We were good friends for about a year and a half, would see each other in groups and individually quite often, without necessarily flirting (she was just out of a long-term relationship, I just thought she was WAY out of my league).\n\nThen, during this past summer we started seeing each other, in a tumultuous sort of way - we'd either both be busy, or spend entire days together in bed - I was about as happy as I've ever been, but she wasn't, and after about 2 months she broke up with me. That was in August, and I still haven't moved on and feel pathetic for it.\n\nSince then, I've seen her a few times in varying capacities, and we still get on really, really well - she couldn't have been more gentle in the way that she ended it with me, and she's always said that it's more to do with her having too much going on in her life rather than it being my fault, and that she still has issues with her past to work through before she can be in a relationship (she's not been seeing anyone since we broke up).\n\nIn a way that just makes it worse by making me think that maybe we'll get back together one day. I'm basically in a bind: I want to move on, but from what she's said to me I actually don't fully believe that we were a bad thing, and though I know that's a really bad way of looking at it, it's not one I can get past.

{"prompt":"I'm a senior in college, about to graduate in spring and I have no desire to pursue a career in my field. I chose Child Development because I wanted to be a preschool teacher. For five summers I volunteered at my mom's preschool and loved it. It's the only career thing I've ever tried and I think that is why I chose it. My sophomore year as I was applying to transfer schools, I knew I no longer wanted to pursue the major but didn't want to waste another year trying to figure it out. So after talking to my parents, they convinced me to transfer and finish my major or try to change it if I could. My problem is that although I know I don't want to pursue this career, I do not have any dream job or even any interests in anything. I've looked at other options for things to do in the field such as social work which I don't think I could handle because I would get too attached I think. A school counselor is another option but it doesn't interest me, besides that, I'm not really sure what good my degree would be good for. I love my classes, don't get me wrong so I'm interested but when it comes to the reality of a job to support myself, I don't see my degree being helpful.

I know that's not reasonable but I haven't been able to shake the discomfort.\n\nI was waiting for the right moment to bring it up. For better or worse, it ultimately came out when he told me that he received a request on Model Mayhem from a female model who usually does work for pay, but wanted him to take her photos \"pose for print\" (she will pose and get free prints, and they both benefit). \n\nI asked him if he got the impression anything about the shoot would be sensual or flirtatious, and in more words he basically said flirting brings out the best shots. I told him that I was uncomfortable with him shooting naked women and I was uncomfortable with him knowingly heading into a situation where he would be flirtatious with some other woman. Those are my hard limits on the situation.\n\nBetween telling him that I was uncomfortable with him shooting nude women, flirting with models, and photographing me, he took that as me being generally unsupportive of his hobby and even condemning it. I tried explaining that this wasn't the case. Unbeknownst to him I have been searching for the perfect photography-related birthday gift for awhile, including a cool place to go take shots and some photo books that would serve as inspiration.\n\nI don't see myself becoming comfortable with being his \"model\" or him shooting nudes or flirting with models anytime soon.

{"prompt":"So the problem is, is that me and my long distance relationship girlfriend have been dating for 9 months now. We have met up 3 times and the last one, which ended over 2 weeks ago, we were together for 8 weeks. Now when she flew back she's cried every day since and thinks i hate her crying in front of me. \n\nAt first i was upset, i was very upset as you could expect and this lasted for around a week. So we both cried together and tried to make one another feel better. However, we argued a few times when she was crying and she says that i hate her crying in front of me now. This is not the case, the only times i have gotten angry and argued when i have had work in the evening, get home around 11 and then she cries for around 2-3 hours and i try to make her feel better but it does not work. This is the only time we argue when she cries, the reason i get mad at this time is because i have work the next morning and have to get up at 6:45 and if i'm up until 2am in the morning trying to make her feel better but nothing happens.

He said missing the opportunity to feel wanted by new people, options, and with that, the responsibility to one person. \n\nI told him that I know how he was feeling right now, that I've felt it too, and that I know that it can be really scary.

{"prompt":"To preface this, I am ending my freshmen year at college and did pretty well.

About three weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to start learning app development for iOS as a hobby and bought a Mac Mini. I have quite a few plausible ideas that I could do after a ton of learning. I think about it all the time, I find it pretty entertaining, and it could help resumes after school.\n\nSo here's the issue. Instead of going through the online classes on my Mac, I always end up spending my time on my desktop computer where it has about 40 games, and 400gb of shows and movies. I will come home, and then play Battlefield while watching TV for hours on end. I tell myself \"I'll just finish this episode and then switch to my Mac.\", then just start another episode afterwards. I actually broke a controller today and hoped that it would force me to stop playing games. I ended up playing with my keyboard and mouse instead. I end up wasting my entire day somehow; over and over and over. And I know that I'm wasting time *AS* I waste it! What really is messing with me is the fact that I **really really DO want work on the app development! I literally look forward to it, but I cannot, for some reason, ever actually do it.**\n\nHow do I combat this? Do I delete the games and shows on my desktop? Is that extreme?

We have mutual friends and she knows my situation, and when I asked her if she would want to hang out again some time, she said she would, but that under the circumstances she thinks it's best we stay friends.\n\nI told her I appreciated her being direct with me and that I completely respect where she's coming from. Then I texted her saying I was thinking of getting the group together and asked if she wanted to join, but she never responded. I am a little bit concerned that I rushed to asking her on a date, since the time we had hung out and had a lot of fun was the same night I told that group of friends about my ex and I splitting, so obviously the subject was talked about some (nothing bad, we are on good terms, but I'm sure I was a little down\/zoned out at some parts of the night). I wish I had waited until we hung out with a group again before asking her out, so she could see I was doing well and not talking about my ex.\n\nAm I permanently friend-zoned? It really did seem like we had some chemistry. I am also worried she might not come out with that group again to avoid anything awkward though. I have been tempted to text her again but I haven't. I assume her not responding means I should probably hold off. What should I do?","chosen":"I asked a girl out, she said yes but I don't know if I'm friends with her anymore. Should I ask her back?","rejected":"I asked a girl out, she didn't respond, I am worried she doesn't want to be friends.\n\nThanks for the help!"}

I'm an overly friendly dude: everyone I talked to smiled at or hugged me through the night -- star footballers, indie kids, this group of hipster chicks, and, especially, my girlfriend's friends.  They thought I rocked. My jokes were hilarious, my vibe was essential, and I won beer pong every round.\nMy game was FLAWLESS.\nThen this dude with game that rivals mine and happens to be really, really attractive... he rolls in with his friends.

{"prompt":"Background: when my wife and I met, three years ago, she was very sweet. It's initially why I liked her; no girl had ever been that nice to me. We got along great. I was a bit worried because there were times when I acted like a dick and she stayed nice. I told her to stand up for herself if I was being a jerk.\n\nWe got married after 1.5 years together. It was a pretty terrible year. I became depressed and no doubt took that out on her sometimes. She started fighting back, calling me out on my behavior. I want to say that 80% of the time, she started fights. They were usually about me doing something she didn't like. This arguing got so bad that I started to consider divorce, blaming mostly myself. I wanted her to be happy, and I wasn't making her happy.\n\nTwo months ago she started going to therapy and a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist got her started on some kind of anti-depressant\/anti-anxiety med which she takes every day. I don't know if it's a coincidence, but right around that time my wife did a complete 180. \n\nShe is basically like when we were going out: affectionate, often laughing, nurturing, a bit submissive. \n\nBefore, she'd get upset if I made a joke that she found deragatory or mean-spirited, now she laughs. Before, she'd get upset if I criticized a dinner she made, now she takes note of it and changes how she cooks. Before, she would watch and listen to whatever she wanted, now she doesn't if she knows I hate it.\n\nIm a bit worried about her. I want her to be happy. She seems really happy lately, and we've been having fun like old times again. I just worry that she's surpressing herself. And I think it's kind of creepy that meds can do this to someone.

We have both told each other 'I love you' for quite some time. \n\nWhen it happened it hurt a bit (as expected) and after it was over I was quite emotionally shaken and feeling a bit sore. We cuddled for a couple of minutes, but soon I could feel that he wanted to get up and clean up. After a passing comment about being sweaty and how hot it was, I rolled on my side and just tried to calm myself down a bit. So he went and did his thing, he got back and I went and had a shower. I got back and he was on his computer, looks over and says \"how are you?\", with me obviously not being okay.\n\nIn short there was not much cuddling or level of emotional bonding that I had expected after, but the main thing that made me irritated and made me upset was that there was no \"I love you\".

We became friends during that time, and were dating for 5 months long-distance. I got tired of the commutes and not seeing her, so moved in when one of her 2 roommates bailed on them. She's felt a little overwhelmed and would like some strategies in helping her feel independent and not get lost in the relationship playing a role.\nIt's a 3 bedroom house, and I have my own small bedroom with my desk, computer, clothes, etc. and the large bedroom is basically hers, aside from the bed we share. The roommate is in the bedroom furthest from ours. My gf is working on her thesis, so it's a lot of time alone in her room typing and such. I'm looking at getting into trying some new hobbies, thinking a martial art, and maybe some dance classes.

She was very very depressed, there were times where i would pick her up drunk and she would try to hurl herself out of a moving car. She would tell me that she didn't want to live and many other things that are cold cut signs of severe depression. \n\nAlong the way I tried my very best to help her, but nothing was working. I had my problems too and trying to handle both was stressing me out. I was managing, but stressing. Then one day she told me that right before we started dating she was sleeping around with her ex. Now I understand that we were not \"official\" but I invested so much time into her that I felt so disrespected. I wanted to break up with her but I decided against it. The only problem was I was so back and forth between whether or not to end out relationship it was messing with her mind.\n\nI promised her that i wasn't going to break up with her, that I am just working through my emotions which I was. but the day after her FIRST therapy session she told me (almost in a bragging manner) that she told her friend she wanted to cut her self. \n\nThat was my tipping point, I am so worried about her harming herself that I am beginning to become depressed. and we have only been dating for month! I feel as if she is throwing her well being on my shoulders and I cant take care of me and her at the same time. \n\nSo I ended the relationship saying that I was unhappy, that her depression is what she needs to be focusing on not our relationship. I was her world and she would do anything for me, but I want HER to be HER world, for her to believe in her self and do what makes HER happy. I see that im getting in the way of that and she is placing her happiness on me.\n\nThis happened last night, and I feel like a monster. Did I do the right thing?","chosen":"GF will do anything for me, I was getting in the way of her happiness.

{"prompt":"My BF (M21) and I (F20) have been together for two years, he has been with his company for over a year and a half.\n\nMy boyfriends boss\/manager in training (F25) has been very in inappropriate towards him at their Christmas party, and it happened right in front of me.\n\nIt started out fine but she started to follow us around, eventually bursting in between him and I and rubbing her breasts on him trying to coax him to take picture with her and staff. It was obvious her intentions were with her bust rubbing against him. She gave him a pet name and has called him it a few times now, a pet name more for partners not for a boss to be calling a co-worker. She conveniently was calling him late after the party after we had left because of her. And now her Facebook profile picture is of just the two of them, with their other co worker is cropped out.\n\nHe now has gone to HR about this and it has been recorded on file that it has happened. But they only just want to talk to her. No other repercussions. Just a slap on the wrist and he and herself will still be working together, she still has her job title.\n\nBasically HR reasoning is that because she was intoxicated and it wasn't specifically at work, its less serious. I feel like HR is bullshitting because if he was female and \"her\" boss rubbed his privates on \"her\" while intoxicated it would be a whole nother story.\nI'm struggling with this and I feel he is too. What she has been doing altogether and even each separate scenario is highly inappropriate for boss behavior. I'm at my wits end here.\n\nOn a girlfriend level I'm so upset, I can only imagine how he feels... I visit him at his work on a fairly regular basis for lunch and walks once he gets off and now when I see her I just get very upset all over again. I feel she should lose her job, as she is a boss\/manager in training. I feel a slap on the wrist doesn't do much for my so as he will also still be having to see her daily and worry she might do it again.","chosen":"BFs boss in training has been very inappropriate towards him and it happened right in front of me.

{"prompt":"My girlfriend and I broke up about a month ago. Any \"fights\" we had were disagreements, loved hanging out together, and we lived together for 6 months and it brought us closer together.

We work together, so I have to see her once a week when our hours overlap. I have been trying to be friendly (chatting with her, having lunch together) but I feel stand-offish and passive-aggressive now that our relationship is over. I know from past experience that I have a really hard time letting romantic feelings go if I have to keep seeing that person, but every other experience has been the other person not reciprocating (see \"friend-zoned\"). With her it feels different, yet the same.\n\nAnyways, I am posting because this weekend is the big premiere of her opera. It's the first time she's ever had a lead role, and she wants me to go. I told her I would think about it, but I can't come to a decision. On the one hand, I feel like it's going to drudge up a lot of emotions I haven't been able to get a grip on, especially my reunion fantasies. But I also feel like I'm bailing on someone really significant to me, on a very important night of their life.

I plan to take the pills the first couple of times before sex and then see how well I do after that without the pills.

He's paying for all his expenses over here and we're planning a trip to a big city in my state after a few days of meeting my family and being in my hometown.\n\nAnother thing, I'm still very dependant on my mom (she still grounds me!). I'm trying not to be, trying to fix past mistakes (which revolved around my pretty bad depression), and looking for a job. Still, I haven't found one, and I still need her to pay for my school. I help around the house and have been writing down everything I owe her lately, too. My goal is to be self sufficient by next year. \n\nThe problem is my mom doesn't like him. She's never even exchanged a word with him, mind you, but not for lack of trying. She just fb stalked him and made a crapload of snap judgements. Our age difference and long distance nature hasn't exactly helped my cause either. I think meeting him would soothe a lot of her anxieties, but I'm still not sure.\n\nAnyway, she's been saying that she might not even let me go to the 3 day trip within a trip with him. He needs to book these reservations now.

{"prompt":"Unlike a lot of TIFU posts I've read recently, this one actually did happen today. I work in a factory that makes mainly motor parts and some medical. I've spent the last few days grinding some shafts down to size for shipping. Every morning I have to top up the coolant tank on the grinder. As we were a man short today, I also had to check the parts being made at the moment were still within tolerance.\n\nSo first thing I did when I got in today at 8 am was go up to the back of the factory, put the hose into the coolant tank and turn it on, with the intention of checking the first part and then shutting off the hose after about 5 minutes. I think you can see where this is going. Roughly 8.45am, I noticed some coolant in behind one of the machines about halfway down the factory. I looked at it for a few seconds while thinking \"Huh. I wonder where that- OH SHIT!!\" Started to run towards the grinder and as soon as I stepped clear of the machine I was working on, I was suddenly splashing through a milky white sea of coolant. Ripped the hose out of the tank and spent the next 3 hours cleaning it up with a TINY wet\/dry vac that we have just to clean up small oil spills. Needless to say, I'm utterly exhausted, my back is killing me from constantly having to empty the vaccum, and my ears are still burning from the bollocking I got off the boss.","chosen":"TIFU by flooding half the factory floor with coolant, boss yelled at me for doing it and won't let me even take a break because of it.","rejected":"TIFU by flooding half the factory floor with coolant.

I had just gotten out of a very serious, very long relationship and *told* him I wasn't ready for something intense with him.  But we'd been friends for years, and he really wanted to try \"us\".\n\nHe broke up with me shortly after saying \"I love you\" and getting \"Oh\" back.  He started dating someone new the next day and they've been together for almost 8 months now. \n\nBefore our relationship (and during) we were close friends.  We're both very reasonable, level headed people.  I assumed that after a brief \"break\" we could be friends again.  But when I attempted to resume contact (step 1: going to the same mutual-friend events and talking casually with him) I found out that his new girlfriend doesn't want him to talk to me.  She's asked all of our mutual friends not to invite me if *they* are going to be there.\n\nSome awful shenanigans resulted from this and our group of friends experienced some drama.  I stepped back entirely and basically told him to either control his woman or tell me to fuck off *himself*.  Don't send a messenger.\n\nHe apologized, but we haven't spoken since.  I've heard from mutual friends that he never goes out anymore (without her) and that on the rare occasions they see him w\/out her, he drinks to the point of blacking out.  \n\nMy first time seeing him in four months was at my sister's wedding last weekend (sans girlfriend).  He wouldn't speak to me at all, though I spent a lot of time with our mutual friends (all at the same table).  Then he got blackout drunk and vomited in the parking lot for about an hour.\n\nI don't know what's going on.  He never used to drink like this.

I responded and kept the conversations going. We started getting closer and closer to the point she wanted to date me again and told me that she loved me. We started dating about 5 months ago. Things were going great until she decided to confess that she cheated on me last time we dated. She broke up with me because she liked the other guy. She said that that was the past and now she loves me a lot. She told me this because she wanted to be completely honest with me.\nI am furious with this situation.

{"prompt":"So we met about 5 years ago when we woke up spooning on a mutual friend's couch after a drunken party. She's a 9.5\/10, I'm maybe a 6 (7 on a good day). I had just broken up with my ex-GF and so was in rebound mode and developed an instant crush. Since we both had lots of mutual friends and I knew she was out of my league, I hid my feelings and deliberately avoided her at parties and basically just acted like a dick towards her. Eventually she called me out on it, asking me why I hated her so much. I shrugged it off and spent the next few months trying to get over her.\n\nA few years later, we randomly met again at a party and for some reason we just hit it off, laughed a lot and generally enjoyed each others' company. We exchanged numbers and started texting back and forth a lot. During parties where we would normally avoid each other, all of a sudden we would find ourselves taking shots and dancing together a lot. Texts became more flirtatious, and I noticed she never played any games (she would never wait hours or days to respond).\n\nNow I find myself having feelings for her again. I'm scared because we have lots of mutual friends, and I mostly date girls outside our social circle to avoid awkwardness. Also, I don't have many other girl \"friends\" to talk to, so I really do appreciate her as a friend.\n\nI think there may be something there, but also I could just be misreading the whole situation.

{"prompt":"I'm completely new to the term property lien.

Recently a major shipping company filed for bankruptcy and almost all of their containers are being rejected by the ports. Nobody wants the containers back at this time.\n\nI've had multiple containers that are either owned by them or leased to them stored at my facility for nearly a month now and I am being billed daily for using the chassis they are on.If I leave a container at their facility longer than they want I get charged upwards of $100\/day.

{"prompt":"When she moved into the school apartment I was living in last year, I told her I'd be okay with sharing some foods, like butter or raw eggs here and there, mustard, some milk, etc. She works at a grocery store and gets a pretty decent discount, and I had assumed that she would mainly be buying her own groceries and that this would be predominantly need-based or asking first. \n\nWhat she actually began to do was eat the foods that I eat on a daily basis like bananas and hard boiled eggs (that I boiled) and take pretty hefty amounts of my produce, baking supplies, and coffee whenever she felt like it (an example: deciding she wants a whole bowl of cooked spinach and cooking the remaining 3\/4 of a bag of raw spinach that I use for sandwiches and salads). She would then take forever to replace any of it in spite of where she works, and when she did, it was often not what I had originally purchased and she never bought enough to both replace mine and provide herself with her own source of the food. She once finished off my coffee grounds after previously expressing her distaste for coffee and caffeine, and when she brought home a new canister, it was decaf. Little occurrences like this happened regularly.\n\nWe'll be living together again soon, and I'm not sure of how to approach the subject. There are foods that she doesn't take without asking, but the ones that she did take regularly are also the foods I eat every day or nearly every day and need to last me the week.

I, on the other hand, have come to the realization that this relationship just isn't right and I need to break up with her. So, the problem is I don't want to end a very long term relationship \"out of the blue.\" We're not going through a rough patch in our relationship, things are pretty much status quo (which is to say, the relationship has been not great for 3+ years).

{"prompt":"Backstory: In my senior year of college, one of our old roommates had graduated so we interviewed people to fill his spot. One guy (let's call him \"D\") passed with flying colors. He seemed very personable, had a cute girlfriend and we all got along great for the first couple months. Then everything spiraled downhill in a matter of days. He started binge drinking, doing lots of drugs and causing lots of problems. For example, he would rob people and brag about it. One night while he thought I was sleeping, I caught him going through my pants pockets and stealing cash out of my wallet. Needless to say we kicked him out and took him to court. Months later, he was arrested twice in two days, first for trying to return stolen textbooks to the book store, and *the next day* he was pulled over for drunk driving and with stolen laptops in his trunk. Less than a year after that, I got a message from his former GF on facebook informing me that he had died from a drug overdose that was later ruled a suicide.

{"prompt":"So I was visiting my family in a small town about two hours from where I (24\/m) currently live. We were having dinner at a restaurant and the waitress and I were chatting pretty well. Cute girl...whatever. Didn't think much of it other than it's her job. But my sister and female cousin suggested that she was obviously flirting with me and it made sense. They suggested I get her number, which I think she would have given me, but I didn't want to put anyone in an awkward situation so I didn't try. But I kind of regretted it. \nFast forward to today when I'm browsing Facebook and I come across her profile because we have mutual friends (not friends I still keep in contact with but the acquaintances that you never remove from your friends list). With 100% sincerity, I wasn't creeping her. There aren't many people our age in the town I was in so it was just a lucky coincidence. So should I try to send her a message, what should I say, should I just give her a poke and see what she's thinking, or should I just chalk it up as a loss and not worry about it?

{"prompt":"So I (24f) had a cheating ex (23m), we were together about 6 months, and I finally told him he needed to leave me alone. I told him maybe in time we can be friends again, but right now it's all to raw and I can't get over him if I keep talking to him. So I told him I was going to block him, he said no need to block him he would just leave me alone. So I didn't block him. \n\nSo the next day I went to the book store and got home, as soon as I got home I got a phone call asking if I had fun at the book store. \n\nHe was apparently coming to my house to talk to me, saw me leaving and followed me. Then he went shopping, bought me a present and came and gave it to me.\n\nThe past month I have been telling him that I couldn't talk to him anymore, but I kept talking to him for some reason. So I think this time he thought it was going to be the same type of thing. I think when he came over he thought I was just going to be OK.\n\nIt's pretty amazing, he hasn't talked to me in 2 days. But I don't know if he just stopped talking to me or is just driving past my house, which he did when we first broke up and I didn't talk to him for a few days. To be completely honest I miss talking to him so much. I know that it's way better for me not to, but I just miss having that connection with someone. \n\nMy sister told me I should get a gun and all this stuff and I was like he's not going to hurt me.

Because they lived on the same dorm floor both years and had the same major, classes and friends, they basically lived and worked together their entire first half of college. They started talking again a couple weeks ago when they helped each other on homework for their extremely difficult senior capstone class. After that they started scheduling study dates for their upcoming test.\n\nThat's a lot of memories and good reason to be friends, but I can't help but feel insecure. We're long distance this quarter because I took an internship 2 hours away. Their relationship ended and scarred him because she cheated on him repeatedly toward the end with her current bf, and I know she's helped another guy cheat. I don't think they would physically cheat (I'm independently somewhat friends with her), but I'm concerned he might accidentally emotionally cheat. Over the weekend I looked over his shoulder while he was texting her and read texts telling her about how he was so stressed from their upcoming midterm and a fight with his parents that he broke down in the library. He never told me about a fight and it hurt me to read her messages calming him down, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to stress him more before his midterm.\n\nI really like him but this is my first serious relationship and I want don't want to be overly demanding. Is it appropriate, after his tests, to explain why those texts hurt me and to ask to read the rest of his other texts to her? To ask that he not study with her at her place or at his?

I thought whatever, my mom is probably right. \n\nFirst, on friday night I realize I left my calculator at school. Note: I go to a private school and the SAT is held at the local public school, so there is no way I can get my calculator before the exam begins.

Then I leave for the test. My dad drives me 10 minutes to the school. As I get out of the car, I check my bag. No ticket. So I sprint after him. I track his car down as he leaves the parking lot. He is pissed. So furious. So we speed home to get the ticket. I grab it. Its currently 7:40. We speed back and arrive at 7:48.

So at that time, I kinda started going with it, though I was doubtful if I wanted an actual relationship. Anyways, at one point, we were kissing, but I stopped it and mentioned that I wasn't exactly ready for anything to develop yet, due to the previous reasons, so we didn't do anything.

But yet, I have a strange feeling that the only reason I want a relationship is because of sex. I just don't want to hurt someone's feelings again (like my previous one, which she put part of the breakup on me for this) and I don't want to commit to a relationship if I don't have 100% on it.

{"prompt":"Hey, long time lurker, but I figured this would be the best place to look for advice about online dating, so here I am.\n\n20 year old Male, heterosexual, currently in college, but living at home to avoid student loans (worked out pretty nicely with a scholarship), majoring in English.  Due to my schedule, I'm sitting around a lot with my buddies online, not really doing anything productive, so I've thought about maybe signing up for a dating site online just to see how it is.  I've never pursued a relationship in high school--never found anybody in HS worth pursuing a relationship with.  Also had health problems that caused me to drop out a few times and do classes from home, so a relationship was never a big concern.  College is nice, but its primary a commuter college, so relationships are distant at best.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to hear the low-down on dating websites.

At random times throughout my day, usually two or three times, my stomach will begin to feel upset, not exactly painful but I just feel drained and irratible. There's no nausea or indegestion involved, just this feeling of weakness, and I can't quite target where at but it just feels like in the stomach area. \n\nAt first I thought it was just something I ate the first day. Then the next few days I realized this wasn't stopping. I monitored what I ate, tried different foods, cut certain out, cut out gluten, cut out sugars, etc etc.. before all of this my diet was..... decent, kind of all over, I'll eat just about anything from steamed vegetables to a bowl of ice cream. Some notable things I do drink are alcohol on social occasions and C4 (preworkout that has high caffeine and creatine I believe).\nThe C4 I will take sparingly, maybe two or three times a week before intense boxing classes. \n\nOf course you're wondering why at 2 weeks I haven't gone to the doctor and that's because I do not have health insurance.

I've moved before but came back home to take care of my family. I'm at a point in my life where I want to move again, ideally for good.\n\nAlmost a year ago I began talking with a guy I met online through a game.  It's nothing too intense, he lives a few states away and we've just been getting to know each other.  He really wanted to meet and I'm in a better place to travel so I started to plan for a visit.  Out of curiosity, I started looking into the surrounding area to get an idea for what sorts of things we could do while I'm in town.  \n\nAs it turns out, the major city near where he lives fits with what I want and I started looking deeper.  I've spent the past month looking into the neighborhoods, the population\/demographics, weather, nightlife, what the restaurants are like, culture, walkability, etc. in detail.  Everything is within range of what I was looking for, or better.  The weather is the only downside, and even then it's nowhere close to dealbreaker range for me.

{"prompt":"I know this may be an unconventional question to ask here but I don't know what to do. My girlfriend and I message each other a lot. We have some distance right now so I like to talk to her flirty sometimes, just cause I feel it's fun and helps in the relationship. However,it's always one sided, just me basically hitting on her. I know she likes it because I've asked but she is unable to respond to it and every  time I feel disgusting and uncared for. I feel that if you have had a partner for 3 years you should be able to be sexy with them. It seems unfair that it's only me doing this. I tried to be flirty over snapchat with her and she got mad cause I was being \"greedy\". I am normally very sweet to her and shower her with affection, it just really starts to get to me when she is literally never affectionate in that way to me. She tells me that she's never afraid to do anything and that she's adventurous and all that. She went on an all girls trip around Europe to party and sightsee a few weeks ago. I find it disappointing that she can do that, get tattoos over there that she told no one about, and be out drinking until the early hours of the morning with random guys but she can't even be sexy to her own boyfriend. Maybe I come across as demanding but it's been at zero for a long long time and it makes me feel so bad. How could ignoring your partners needs like that ever make them feel good? I always try and take care of her but when I bring this up to her she calls me disgusting and says I don't respect her boundaries. I'm not even asking much of her, just for her to be flirty with me back, but she gets legitametely angered at the request and calls me disgusting.

On the other hand when I like someone, I fall head over heels to the point of being close to obsessed; again it is usually for a friend. I find it difficult to tell them how I feel, because I am afraid this might ruin the friendship (I've lost one friend like this too).

{"prompt":"My girlfriend and I are are university together and have been going our for two years. We are incredibly happy together and love each other very much. However, a year ago I had some temporary doubts and had a number of lengthy Facebook conversations with a female friend of mine in which I was not very nice about my girlfriend, not only sharing very personal information (including about our sex life), but talking about possibly breaking up, speculating about her possible issues and making fun of her. At one point I suggested I'd lied about telling her I loved her, which looking back is not true at all but which made harrowing reading for my girlfriend. If I'm honest I think I probably sounded quite flirty too, though I would not have considered cheating on my girlfriend. \n\nAt the time I hadn't felt that these conversations were as bad as they seem re-reading them, but the other day my girlfriend discovered them on my Facebook account and was horrified and deeply hurt. The day it happened she decided not to break up with me but was struggling to come to terms with what I've said, especially as she couldn't imagine me saying many of the things I had. She also hates being spoken about at all behind her back, even when positively, and now feels betrayed. \n\nI've had to go away for a few days and in my absence everything seem to be playing in her mind non-stop and she's very upset. Her last text to me this evening was 'Pathetic as it is, I still love you xxx'. I love her too, but nothing I can say can make her feel better at the moment.

I've been stressing out about it because I don't want to disappoint them and I don't want them to get mad at me because I went without them. Idk what to do.","chosen":"Bought friends ACL tickets, they promised to pay me back, they haven't paid me back and I have second thoughts about going.","rejected":"Bought friends passes that they promised to pay back but they still haven't. Now they are leaving on a trip next week and I'm not sure if I can go without them."}
