This guy [22\/M] and I started flirting a bit last week, just went on a unofficial double date tonight. He was... Amazing. Smart, sweet, cute, seemed very into me. We could have kept talking for hours it felt like. Before we started the date I was super nervous that this would just hurt, that I wasn't ready, that I wouldn't like him or he wouldn't like me. That was all entirely gone by the end of the night, and I was left with this feeling that I would be okay getting hurt again because the potential relationship that this could become would be worth it. \n\nI leave for a month on August 2, so about a week and a half away.

{"prompt":"I have been employed at my first job as a sales associate for a local family business chain for 6 months.

However I just went into the office where I got the job and my (soon to be) boss hadn't realized that I have student loans not grants and they only hire people who have grants.

They seem to be working things out, and she has cut off communication with the \"other guy.\"\n\nHowever, I know she did not tell her boyfriend ALL of the truth, and he may have no idea that she actually slept with this other person. I find her lack of telling him the complete truth to show that it's possible that she never will tell him. I consider them both friends, though I haven't known them very long. I've actually known her longer than he, but duration of friendship isn't always testament to how strong a bond is. I think he is a great guy, and the longer it takes her to tell him, the more it will hurt him and I don't like to see my friends hurt.\n\nIt seems like the girl wants to just keep lying because she can continue her relationship.

I ended up just talking for an hour during that date and it went pretty well.\nDuring Valentine's day, I sent her a rose to her dorm room. However, I expected a thank you or a text or something, so I automatically assumed that she wasn't interested in me anymore after the date.\nHowever, a few days afterwards, what happened was one of my friends went out on a group dinner with her and her friends and directly asked her if she liked me.

{"prompt":"I'm seventeen years old. I'm a senior in high school. I live in a very close knit town where I go to parties with kids in 10th grade and kids who are seniors in college. We've all known each other forever; it's not weird. Anyway..\n\nA month or so ago I went to a party with a few friends at one of their older brother's houses. We were all hanging out having a good time when a guy who I knew casually walked up to me. We started talking, and before we knew it, we had been chatting it up for nearly an hour and a half. We exchanged numbers and continued to talk. Now, we text each other constantly, and I can't get him out of my head. It amazes me how much we have in common, and it's so easy for him to put a smile on my face. Last weekend, I gave him a ride home from a get together, and while we were sitting in front of his house, he looked at me and said \"This is bad..\" I questioned his statement, and he told me he's falling for me. He told me that he wants to start spending more time with me, and that he doesn't want me to think he's trying anything scummy. (I'm assuming this was to reassure me because he's a notorious lady's man, and is known to get over on girls pretty easily) But, we've been talking for about a month and a half, and we haven't hooked up at all. He seems like an honest and genuine person, and it's hard for me to imagine where all the rumors about him have come from. Here's the most difficult part... he's twenty-two. From what I can tell, he's more mature and more down to earth than most of the guys my age, and the only downfall is the five year gap.. If he was really just trying to get in my pants, why would he have waited this long? He's incredibly attractive and could easily have any girl he wanted, but instead he's been sticking around.\n\nSo Reddit, am I being stupid by even thinking about pursuing this? Is this guy just taking advantage of a naive 17 year old with his looks and charm, or do you think he's really into me?","chosen":"Met a guy on a party, talked for nearly an hour and a half, no sex, no hook up, still can't get him out of my head.","rejected":"I'm 17, lately I've been talking to a 22 y\/o.

{"prompt":"Hi Reddit,\n\nThis is my first post on reddit ever, so please excuse me if I'm not doing this correctly.\n\nI met a very nice girl on plenty of fish about 4 months ago. We get a long great and we have both developed feelings for each other. We spend everyday with each other and were both very happy and content with the way things are going. I haven't been in many relationships before and my last one was a long distance relationship which lasted about 6 years so the dynamics of seeing someone on a consistent basis is very new to me.\n\nDuring the first month of my new relationship we abstained from actual sex, we did however mess around and fore play with in the first 2 weeks of being together. After about a month into this relationship we started to have actual sex on a consistent and regular basis, (4-5 times a week). This has been the same up until about 2 weeks ago.\n\nI noticed she seems to not want it as much now, isn't as intimate with me and doesn't seem as interested. I asked her about this and she says she wants sex less for the build up for when we do have it. She assures me this is the only reason why we are having sex less, however she has a high sex drive, but wants to abstain.\n\nSo I'm left a little confused, she has a high sex drive, we had a lot of good sex in the beginning however that has dropped off and now she wants to wait 2-3 days per \"session\" per say. \n\nThe whole scenario is making me slightly insecure because it happened all of a sudden, or seemed too. \n\nWhat I'm trying to ask is - is this a normal thing for a relationship with the information I posted above? I'm posting due to my lack of experience with regular, consistent relationships in terms of sex.

I told Anna that I was hanging out with Karen, but not specifically what we were doing, and I've elected to not tell Karen about Anna at all, as it's supremely obvious that she wants nothing more than a FWB setup.

I'm not sure if it was technically broken, but it became swollen and slightly crooked. I visited an ENT in a timely manner and made an another appointment with that doctor to have my nose reset. However, I never actually went through with the procedure because of insurance issues. (My car and medical insurers both stated that it was the others' responsibility.)\n\nNow, my nose still remains slightly crooked. I've also been having breathing issues and recurrent nosebleeds since the injury.

Correcting the breathing issues are my priority, but I'd also like to correct the slight crookedness if possible.

While living in Ireland and attending an Irish secondary school, there is no bigger stigma than being someone who is 'a frigdit' i.e someone who has never kissed (or in ireland, 'shifted') someone. After being very socially awkward, lacking in confidence and being self-conscious, it is only now at age 16 that I'm beginning to come out of my shell and actually talk to girls. After asking a few girls whom I liked over the past few months for, 'the shift', I have been met with rejection each time. Keeping \"beggars can't be choosers\" in mind, I decided to lower my standards a bit to a girl that I'm almost certain I have a chance with, however do not really have feelings for. So after the past week of chatting to her, trying to work something out, I have been thinking, what do I do afterwards?

His interactions with her were very intimate; this led to jealousy on my behalf, and amongst a list of other things, fueled the break-up - as I wasn't confident in \"loving myself enough for him to love me.\" In the meantime, this girl has become one of my closest friends, rivaling that of my own sister. \n\nFast forward three months, and I find that our mutual housing agreements have been aborted, through the too-loud mentioning through a closed door.  They thought I wasn't home, and went on to discuss their plans to move in together with the rest of my roommates present (one is getting married, the other is studying abroad.)  \n\nIt seems that everyone knew except for me, and I've never felt so betrayed by the people that I called my \"family,\" several hundred miles from home.\n\nHow to cope with these feelings of isolation, lack of belonging, and betrayal?","chosen":"Ex-boyfriend (25m) and mutual roommate (22f) have made plans to move in together without me (24f), leaving me (24f) to look for my own place.

I have known him a long time, I know when he is lying, and the \"new office girl\" is making him a fibber. \n\nHere are my concerns;\n\n1) When he is more involved with someone at work than he should be he is more prone to bringing up that person over and over again in conversation, the new girl has been brought up A LOT recently.\n\n2) He will say rude things about the women in his office, I think in an attempt to make me think he's not interested, but this is how I know who the attractive girls at his job are. For example, the new girl has been called \"gap tooth\" even though I have seen her facebook and I know that yes, she does have a gap in her teeth, but the rest of her is adorable. So freaking lame of him.\n\n3) He will suddenly get VERY enthusiastic about having sex. Last week he was all about my boobs suddenly. I have good sized breasts but they are mostly ignored as he is an ass man. New girl happens to have large breasts as well, and I dont think it's a coincidence  that this girl with big boobs starts working there and all of sudden my husband is all about my breasts.\n\nAll of this kind of crap annoys me to no end, I feel like when he is having sex with me, he is probably thinking about her, and that makes me want to punch him. So, my question is this...When men have sex with their wife, are they usually thinking about someone else? I mean, how much of this nonsense should I put up with? I dont think he would straight up cheat on me, but the thought of him thinking about her while having sex with me just makes me angry, but I don't know if it should make me angry or if hes just being a guy.

We're getting to the point that surgery might be on the horizon. *This is serious business.* Migraines can sometimes trigger strokes.

{"prompt":"Be sure to explain in detail with line breaks.\n\nOk, I will try to make this as short as possible.  Basically last fall, my friend an I started a more intimate relationship.  It was purely physical nothing serious.  I had given up on wanting a relationship years ago.  But I eventually began having feelings for him.  Before I can say anything, everything just stops and it doesn't get resolved\n\nIn January, I still had unresolved feelings for him that I wanted to get some closure.  So I decide to talk to him about it.  Unfortuantly, that day he hurt himself and instead of talking we spend the day at the hospital.\n\nFast forward, to last week.   He and I have texted back and forth a few times, but really havn't seen each other.  Now I have decided that I finally want to start dating again;  but I was afraid now that he's getting better he may want to start hanging out again, and it may cause me problems with dating other guys. \n\nSo I ask him if we can get together because I need to talk to him.  We do and I tell him I explain everything to him, and tell him that it may be best if we don't talk for a while.  Just so I get over my feelings for him.   He said he understood, but I was unsure ifhe really did.  I thought this would bring closure, but I was wrong.  What I really needed was for him to basically reject me so I would know nothing could ever happen between us.  \n\nSo last night I'm drinking with some friends, and drunk me decides to text him to get that rejection.  Literally, I asked him to just reject me so I could get on with my life.\n\nHe didn't respond, thankfully.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I feel bad for sending it; even though it was what I wanted to say.  I'm not sure if I should apologize and explain.

I actually met her for 30 seconds before they moved on and later I messaged her, got her number yada yada and now we text and snapchat on a semi regular basis.\n\nI'm really confused because I've asked her on a breakfast date where she initially said yes, only to cancel later saying she had shit to do with her mom without making alternative arrangements. When we text, there's times where she just stops replying completely but then sends me snapchats the next day. When we first talked, she complained about her ex a lot when they dated back in February to the point where I had to confront her about me not being her emotional tampon and how I didn't want her to get too comfortable with me despite not knowing each other pretty much. At that point my motivation was pretty low, and I ceased to text her for a month.\n\nRecently after a month of not texting, she texted me first saying hey and asking me how I was doing and we talked a bit about how we were preparing for school. She actually explicitly asked me that we should both get a coffee together at school and I expedited it by suggesting that we should go to our university's kickoff game. She said yes and that it'd be a new thing for her to try but later that night, she said she couldn't go because she had to work an on call shift. (She's a high school tutor so it's busy season now). I totally understood and wasn't blown off by her cancelling, but by the fact that she never makes alternative arrangements and therefore leaves us in a limbo again.\n\nSince I've known her for 30 seconds in person, I'm not emotionally attached, but I would like to give this girl a genuine shot IRL before writing it off and moving on. Should I cut my losses, tell her I'm not content with our interactions being limited to social media or wait for her to start something? Or any other suggestions?

{"prompt":"Tonight I'm attending a Star Wars themed Christmas party, so I thought I'd dress up a little. My initial idea was to wear a cardboard box and call myself an \"ammunition droid\", but my dad threw out all of our larger boxes that I could have made into an outfit. So, Plan B was to dress in a bathrobe and be a low-budget Jedi. After rummaging around my room for some other Jedi-ish looking clothes, I realized I'd need a lightsaber. No problem, all my kid's toys and stuff are stored away in the garage...I couldn't throw out my prized plastic lightsabers I used all the time, right? During my search through the garage, I came across a bin on a high shelf labeled, \"<Poisonbullet9>'s TOYS\". Score! I lifted the bin from its shelf and had a look. Inside were a bunch of boxes that I couldn't remember ever seeing, and where were all my old footballs, army men, and star wars toys?

I think this is because I'm very quiet and this doesn't translate well into online communication, or something, who knows...\n\nAnyways, there's a girl I really like; her family is friends with my family and we somewhat recently got back into contact with them, and we all get along well, her, her younger brother, my younger sister, and I.  The problem is she goes to school pretty far away; about a four hour trip from where I live.  But I really, really like her, and I can't stop thinking about her.\n\nAnother problem is that she is also very shy, and I tried messaging her awhile ago (about 7 or 8 months ago) and it went back and forth a bit, before fizzling out.  \n\nBasically, I am wondering if any of you think it's worth me trying to get to know her better or even telling her that I really like her, and if you might have any tips on how I might go about doing so.\n\nAlso, as for whether or not she might feel the same way about me, I really can't tell.  She is very friendly towards me, she laughs when I try to be funny, and we can talk somewhat, even with being shy, but I really cannot tell if she likes me or not.  We make a fair bit of eye contact when we talk and stuff, though I try to do that with most people.  The only thing I can go off is that when we've left their family the last two times, it's seemed that she's made a (perhaps very slight) effort to say more of a goodbye to me, but that could be in my head, and also I saw her glance at me once (reading that back now sounds totally desperate but I'll leave it in there).\n\nAnyways, hope someone (or multiple someones) might have some advice \/ tips \/ something to help me out.

Things began to heat up between us, with both of us lamenting our relationship status and how we felt lonely and horny. As we became closer, we started realizing that we both really identified with each other and even made frequent jokes about how we are \"exactly the same person\", because our life situations and personalities are so similar and mesh so well with each other. This culminated about two weeks ago, when we both ended up admitting to each other than we wouldn't mind a purely sexual relationship between the two of us since we were both so horny.\n\nNow I don't know where we stand. I don't know how I feel about her--I've never really even been in a real relationship in my life. I'm attracted to her, and I care about her a lot--but I'm not sure where the line is drawn from a FWB situation with a close friend to a relationship. I know she's also confused about her feelings about me, and we haven't even had full on sex with each other yet (although we certainly have been very frisky and had some enjoyable sexual encounters with each other). \n\nWhat makes a \"relationship\" exactly?

It made me feel terrible, and I cleaned up my act. I didn't look at other women, I didn't speak with other women, and I always did my best to be there for her when I could. It's hard to do this for me, because I'm in a fraternity here at my college, and social presence is particularly important in our organization; especially with the ladies.\n\nSo this past weekend, she calls me Sunday morning and tells me she went out with some friends, got drunk, and hooked up with someone.

I slept on the couch, literally for 3 years until we moved to a new house and I got my own room in the basement.\n\nFor 3 years after my son was born we fought almost daily.

However, I don't like criticizing him because he normally tries really hard, his self-esteem is on the lower side, and this is his first time. I really like him and I hate not talking to him; I just have never felt so alone in a relationship before. \n\nHe's not like any other guy I've dated before. I have no idea how to handle the quiet and inexperienced type, and for some reason his feelings seem that much more delicate. Any advice is highly appreciated.","chosen":"Boyfriend not talking to me and I don't know how to handle it.","rejected":"My bf doesn't talk to me for the first 2-3 weeks of a 3 month relationship and I don't know what to do, or how to handle the situation."}
{"prompt":"I've been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for 14 months. She wanted a hiatus to focus on school, she felt a lot of pressure from our relationship, and she needed to figure things out. I messaged her again last week, and told her I still missed her. We had our first conversation in 8 months and kind of caught up with what's been going on in each others lives.\n\nI interpreted this as she was ready to restart our relationship, but she stopped talking to me after two days. She hasn't messaged me since Thursday and I've messaged her every day since then. Idk why she's not responding to my messages. Maybe she's just not in the mood to talk, maybe she isn't ready to restart out relationship yet, maybe she was just busy with other stuff, maybe she's stressed out because she's starting school and doesn't want to handle our relationship on top of that, or maybe she doesn't love me anymore.\n\nI really don't know how to handle the situation. Should I ask her why she's not talking to me? Would that approach be too aggressive\/controlling (I want you to talk to me right now and if you don't I'll be upset kind of thing)? Should I confront her about it? If so how? Should I stop messaging her or would that make me seem disinterested?\n\nAlso just a side note. I know most suggestions on here are to break up with the person, but I'm not breaking up with her so if that's your suggestion don't bother.\n\nThanks for reading!

I was told this by several people who didn't like her bitching about this behind my back, and wanted me to know what she'd been saying. Anyway, I wasn't very offended but I was pretty annoyed at the ignorance and the idea of her spreading this rumour that I liked her, when I had a gf. For the next two years I sat next to her at every possible opportunity, including the bus home (This was not my bus, but I always got it with a friend after school so we could hang out for a bit.

I started my full-time career 3 years ago back in 2012 and worked at this Korean music management company for two years. I loved 70% of my job and I hated the rest of the 30% which involved a lot of bs and politics within the company that really overtook the good sides of the job. I was also being fed up with Kpop scenes so I ended up quitting the job early 2014.\n\nI left Korea right after I quit to try something else. I wasn't doing too well but I definitely enjoyed my time learning and seeing new things in music scenes of N. America.

For all last night, all I could think about was, \"oh god I hope she's not doing anything with anybody\"\/\"Maybe she didn't come home because she went home with someone else\"\/\"God damn it I just want her to be home so I know she's not doing anything\" and other things like that. But I wouldn't let myself text or call her to find out what she was doing because I didn't want to impede on her \"space.\" This was almost torture and to put myself through that for anything longer than last night would be like self inflicted wounds. So when I awoke I saw baonnnnnnnnn's comment about just letting go and becoming Doc Chubs 2.0, this was what really snapped for me. \n\nSo in conclusion, I have awoken today, I went for a run, did some other work out stuff (which, is unheard of for my fat lazy ass) and after my shower I started packing all of my stuff. I have in the past hour gotten nearly everything of mine out of the apartment and in my car ready to move. I plan on leaving on Sunday still because I have work soon and don't have the time to fully move out. However, once I am out I plan on not talking to her at all for at least a month, unless she contacts me which of course I will be civil and would accept nothing more than a plutonic friendship!\n\nSo I would like to thank everyone who commented, it really did help snap me out of my denial or shock or whatever I was in.

I didn't come to be with her because of sex, but i am a guy and i do enjoy sex and it we got to a point where it was just once a week and to be honest i could live with that because there is a lot more to relationships than just sex, but the once a week thing only happens when we have discussion after discussion on why i want to have sex again.\n\nIt got to a point where i really felt detached because i feel like i had to beg for sex and so i set out looking for a solution, after reading reddit and a few websites i saw that the PILL could cause negative libido and a few woman had described that sex felt like a job they only did because their SO asked them to.\n\nWell now we get to the problem, my gf is a stubborn little girl and its really hard to change her mind once shes set on something and in my haste i didn't think the problem through and i made a deal with the devil, i ran to her saying that i would give up sex for two months if she gave up the pill for two months, to be honest i figured she would say no and we would negotiate and then figure something out.. but alas she said yes and thus today she skipped her pill and begins my two months of non sexual adventures.\n\nAnything i can do to salvage this deal and put me back in the sexual spotlight ? or do i have to just suck it up and deal with the next two months.","chosen":"i asked her to stop taking the pill for 2 months and i would stop having sex with her for 2 months she agreed, i wanna renegotiate xD","rejected":"asked for sex for two months, girlfriend said yes, now she's skipping her pill"}

A couple of details seemed odd to me, though - a central location was a club named \"Ragnarok.\" I realized I knew the word but not its story, and looked it up online. And read a bit more of Norse myth. And a bit more.\n\nThen I went back to try the game again. The cop who gets killed early on, starting the plot - name of Balder. Cold winter, only getting colder. \"Starting to sound exactly like the myth of Ragnarok. Neat!\" The mysterious old man is named Woden, an alternate reading of Odin? The evil superdrug is named Valkyr, now we're getting a little heavy-handed. But still neat.\n\nThen the second game came out. I fully expected the writers to let the Ragnarok theme drop a little, but was looking forward to *Shootmans 2: Fly Slower*. The closing credits to the game was a song, \"Late Goodbye\" by Poets of the Fall. I didn't listen to much music except as a background, but I liked it. First single I bought, and they're now my favorite band.\n\nThen I went back to try the game again. It pops up all through the game, I noticed - some random janitor is blaring it over his headphones. One gangster plays it on the piano of an apartment they'd just massacred. The love interest sings it - *badly* - in the shower. I felt it worked perfectly - Our hero was just getting over the loss of his wife and kid, just starting to reconnect with another person, and hating himself for it.

Unfortunately he thinks we REALLY did.......\n\nAnyways, I'm not sure how much information I have to give him when explaining why I don't want to see him anymore, so this is one question I have.\n\nMy main question is HOW? He's ALWAYS texting me, and we don't spend any time talking on the phone or anything, so it might be weird to call. But it doesn't seem necessary to tell him in person or anything. Is it completely ridiculous for people our age to say \"no thanks\" to future dates via text? Obviously calling is a lot more stressful, but if it's the right thing to do, I will.","chosen":"boy asks me out, I go on two dates, afterwards he keeps texting\/calling me, but I don't want to see him. how do I tell him this?","rejected":"How do I let him know I am no longer interested in seeing him or getting involved with him?

I also explained that I appreciated his passion, but I just don't like to take anything too seriously, and I'm really bad with dealing with it when people are sensitive about something, since I don't really feel that strongly about things like that. I told him I really hate hurting people's feelings, and he said I could use some more tact.\n\nLater on, I told him I felt weird about everything, though I said it's kinda my fault. He was nice and said it was kinda his fault too.

{"prompt":"Hi\n\nI've been with my gf for just under 2 years. Generally, we get along quite well.\n\nWe moved in together about 11 months ago. At the time she had no one else to move in with and I felt kind of pressured without her actually asking and I ended up asking her to move in with me. I also got the impression she was doing it because some of her friends were moving in with their partners and so forth, I did bring this up at the time. When we were discussing moving in together I raised the issue that she does not earn much money and has a lot of credit card debt and a car loan, so I did not want her relying on me for money.\n\nSince we've moved in we generally we get along well, not much fighting. There have been a few issues, mainly surrounding \"give and take\" e.g. I felt like I was supporting her a lot and she did very little for me in return. I feel like the situation has improved somewhat but still not quite where I'd like it to be.\n\nI've never been quite sure whether I'd like to be with this girl forever, there are a few things I'm not sure about. I don't know whether I'm being nit-picky or whether I should be genuinely concerned e.g. she seems very quick to judge some people, quite anti-intellectual at times and very immature with money.\n\nIn addition to all that, I don't know what I want from her. I really really enjoyed the freedom of being single prior to being with her.\n\nIn the last couple of days I decided it'd be nice to move out to my own place when our lease is up (in about 5 weeks). Not surprisingly, she is very upset about it. I'm looking for a bit of clarity on whether it's worth trying to get over these issues or if it's better to cut my losses? I'd appreciate any insight you guys could offer!","chosen":"asked to move in together, she moved in with me.

Text gives me the opportunity to read what I am saying to make sure it makes sense, whereas I seem to have conversational ADD and say shit that makes absolutely no sense sometimes. So it seems the only way that I can actually capture a girl's interest (Shit on a stick robbed me of homecoming queen at uglyville high school) is to actually establish my personality (the non-retard that I am around my friends) with them through text, and then work my way out (or in, depending on if you are Barney Stinson or not)\n\nI didn't ever initiate conversation with the two I wasn't dating specifically to sleep with them, and I have been romantically interested in them both.

We have been together for a little over a year. \n\nThis weekend one of my boyfriend's friends from high school, Emily, came down to visit our college with a group of her friends. This was my first time meeting her, she seems really nice, and she has a long distance boyfriend of around three years. Last night started out with me studying at the library until about 10pm because I have an exam next week. Emily came in during the afternoon and has been spending time with my boyfriend and some of their other high school friends. After I got enough work done, I joined Emily and bf and we went out to bf's frat last night. \n\nShe was supposed to spend last night at a hotel with her friends, but instead she ended up staying with my boyfriend and I at his frat until around 3 am.

I was fine with this because my boyfriend assured me she would not sleep over because I told him that it made me uncomfortable. He said something to the effect of \"I love you and would never cheat on you.\"\n\nHe says that they were chatting and it got really late and they both ended up really tired so he tried to be a nice guy and he let her stay over. She slept in his bed, and he slept on the couch. I feel extremely disrespected because he allowed her to spend the night even though I told him it made me uncomfortable beforehand, and doubly so because he allowed another woman to sleep in his bed and I think that's extremely inappropriate. I don't think he would cheat on me and she and I got along really well while all of us were hanging out. My boyfriend says he was just trying to be a nice guy and not inconvenience his friend, but this makes me feel even worse because that means convenience for her was put above my feelings which I don't think were unreasonable. \n\nWhat do I do reddit?

{"prompt":"So I [26\/M] have been in a relationship with a really nice and cool girl  [24\/F] for about 5ish months. \n\nWhen we first started dating I told her that the contract for my current job is up in May of 2014 and I would be looking at some possible career opportunities that might be in other cities and long distances away. She was cool about it and understood but still wanted to date. We took it as a \"week by week\" approach and a sort of \"we'll see where this goes\". \n\nWe had a good talk about 6 weeks ago that my search was narrowing and my career might take me to a city that's about 8 hours away and if that's the case I'm not sure I could keep up with a long distance relationship. She understood and we kept moving along.\n\nOver the last couple of weeks things are starting to get finalized for me with that opportunity and I've decided that this is a really great career move for me and that I'm going to go for it. I'd still have about 2-3 months left in our current city and will be moving this summer.\n\nI've decided that within this I want a fresh start and don't feel strongly enough about her to want to make it work that long distance.

I had him either cut off all ties with all those girls or we're over. He chose me. I have so many trust issues with him due to being betrayed the first year and a half of our relationship. My family does not like him, even though they don't know about the cheating, so it makes a huge conflict of me going out with him. My mother always interferes with my relationship saying hurtful things about him. He honestly has changed in my eyes but I can't seem to forget about the things he did to me in the past. \n\nAny advice on overcoming horrible past experiences? Or the fact that I will never be able to look past it is a sign that we shouldn't be together. Ask any questions you'd like because I have not gone into great detail really. Thank you for reading.","chosen":"boyfriend cheated on me 3 times in 1 year and 10 months, mother interferes with relationship to the point of ruining it, need advice on past experiences to overcome terrible treatment.","rejected":"boyfriend cheated on me 3 times. trust issues with him due to past flirting\/cheating. need help overcoming horrible past experiences. help plz."}

{"prompt":"Over a decade ago, I was a typical high school student who rode the yellow school bus.  I saw my fair share of people ranging from elementary to middle-school to high school everyday.  Having not progressed in coolness to sit at the back of the bus (freshman year), I shared a seat with a troubled middle schooler who was bullied to no end, and he decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nOne day I was casually talking with him, not being \"friends\", and he revealed his frustration in tears of the bullying he recieved daily.  He opened his bag and revealed a 9mm pistol that he was going to use to \"solve\" his problems.\n\nI was shocked, but I didn't make a scene.  I knew so many people who were ruined by the choices they made, and I didn't want him to be the next.  Having been bullied, beaten, hit, and made an outcast for fighting back, I knew what he was going through, and I talked him out of it.  Explaining to him that he was better than those assholes, and that he had potential for a better future than this course of action was going to take, I offered to dispose of the pistol for him.  He placed it in my bag.\n\nI couldn't go home or find another way back.  I had dismantled the pistol on the toilet, and I kept it on me until I got home in the afternoon.  I promptly threw it away.  I was scared the entire day, but thankfully nothing within the time he was a part of that school district did an unfortuneate event happen.  \n\nI've told no one until now.

{"prompt":"Hi all,\n\nI have an unbeatable job offer at a company in Silicon Valley. I previously worked at this company as an intern, and I love the projects, the people, and the ability to grow and learn there.\n\nMy other option is to stay home or close to home, and start my own gig or take-up a job there. Why would anyone ever consider doing this? Let me explain.\n\nMoving across the country and away from everything I've ever loved is very difficult for me. It also means I lose my SO or at the very least a long distance relationship for a while ( which doesn't work ). There are complex reasons based around her certifications that don't make sense for her to move. She has been a life changing person for me, and is truly someone I want to have a future with. For context, we have been seriously dating for almost 2 years. \n\nOn the other side, I feel like I'm throwing away everything I've worked for. I spent my entire childhood, college, and free-time working towards an opportunity like this. I would be throwing away a huge compensation package, and the ability to learn things and meet people that I could never do anywhere else.  When I was at this company as an intern, I had all of these same perks, but I felt so empty not being able to do any of the things I loved growing up. \n\nThe advice that I'm seeking is about how crazy it would be for me to throw away this offer. The reason it scares me is because if it weren't for this girl, I would be on a plane tomorrow. I don't want the relationship to go sour and be kicking myself in the ass in a year or two. My hometown has opportunities for me to do very well, but it's not even on the same scale.","chosen":"potential job offer in Silicon Valley, love the company, but staying in my hometown would be throwing away everything I've worked towards.

{"prompt":"My fiancee today had a bit of a breakdown and at first kept saying I didn't really love her, I was just staying with her ( my first gf ) because I hadn't experienced anyone else. I told her this wasn't true, and I loved her and was happy with her. Then it turned into a \"its always about you, you, you..\" and how she always does so much for me as if I don't do anything for her, don't adequately show her affection and don't make her feel loved. I asked what I could do differently, what more she was needing \/ wanting and she couldn't answer. I do my best, and I know I'm busy with school and work, but it's certainly not a 1-sided relationship. Later on I lay down next to her and after a while she says she is afraid of only being with 1 person, and missing out on experiences. \n\nI feel like she is really wanting to break up with me, but I think she is afraid to. We've been together for 5 years now, and haven't had any big relationship problems. I don't know where this is all coming from. She did just take a 3 day trip to see a friend from high-school in a different state, but I trust her and don't think she cheated on me. Maybe I'm just ignorant and missed a lot of the signs, but I feel like this is all a really quick turn around on how I thought things were going. I'm really scared to bring up the topic with her, and we haven't spoken for about 5 hours now, I've only seen her when she walks past me to go to the restroom where she closes the door (which we never do. no idea what shes doing in there..) and stays inside for 10 minutes.

{"prompt":"So, a buddy mine approached me today, asking for a favor.  He's was on Plenty of Fish and met a cool girl he really liked and got along with.

Growing suspicious, he asked her for a photo confirming her identity.\n\nNote: Photo has been altered to hide her face.  There's no photo on her Plenty of Fish profile, but she did have a Skype profile image,which matches this one.\n\nSomething seemed off about the photo to my friend,and I offered to take a look  at it, since I'm pretty familiar with Photoshop and altering image.  I took one look at it, and it looked damn fake to me, based on the text on the card.\n\n1- The zeros on the card appear to be identical\n2- The 1 and the p's lines are completely vertical\n3- Little pixelation around the text, even at when magnified.\n\nNow it's totally possible this is a legit photo, maybe the girl just keeps it around for verification and digitally adds the date as needed.

{"prompt":"We've been going out for two years, and we've been having a lot of trouble lately. Normally, we're happy as two people can be. But it's been hard.\n\nHe has a lying problem. He's had drunk conversations with women, then not told me about them until I went through his phone. I know going through his phone is normally a big no-no, but every time I've done it, I've found something. And he's promised me complete transparency. Still lies, just deletes more texts now.\n\nWe had a huge fight, and he apologized about a thousand times. Swore to God he'd never do something like this again. Told me he'd learned his lesson by almost losing me. Said I can have access to anything I want, anytime, even though we've tried that before.\n\nSo I gave him a sort-of ultimatum: if he EVER lies to me about something he shouldn't again, I leave him then and there. Now I consider that a sort-of ultimatum because in most relationships, faithfulness is expected.\n\n**The Plan:** I want to send a sexy message to him from a fake profile. I mean, I want to make it legit, too. Not obviously fake. Maybe even just start with a normal conversation and see if he'll let it evolve into anything further. I want to see if he's really changed, or if he would at least tell me this time. I want to see if he'd respond, then immediately delete the message. I just need to know his reaction. He's a very handsome dude, and I feel like this exact scenario would happen to him in the future, anyway. So I'd like to know before hand if he'd make the same mistakes again.

I'll start to give him one and if he was doing something on his phone, sometimes he's continued looking at that for several minutes while ignoring me.

{"prompt":"I am a 23 y\/o female and my boyfriend is a 24 y\/o male. We have been together for one year.\n\nA few months ago I was snooping on his Facebook messages and saw he had messaged a girl from his work. It was a pretty casual, friendly conversation, with maybe some slight innocent flirting (he said to her at one point \"it's a bummer we don't work together more often!\" for example). She was also very beautiful, so I freaked out. I am beautiful too but I have low self-esteem, so I completely thought the worst, as in he contacted her because he was into her.\n\nSo I discussed it with him and apologized for snooping. He was very understanding and told me she was only 17, so he definitely didn't see her that way, and that it doesn't matter at all because he loves me and would never cheat on me or leave me for someone else. He said at that time he messaged her, she was having \"family drama\" and had been talking to him about it at work. He saw she was online and decided to see how she was doing and cheer her up.\n\nI guess my concern still is that is it normal for guys in relationships to talk to their attractive coworkers outside of work? I personally don't use instant messaging so I find it hard to relate. My boyfriend is an extremely friendly person, and I know for a fact he is friendly with everyone at work, so maybe he is just the same way online? I just can't seem to get passed how pretty she is and think he was messaging her because he wanted to talk to a pretty girl:( He had text messaged and talked to this other girl from his work in the past but I never batted an eye because she wasn't prettier than me in my opinion.

{"prompt":"A year ago, my current husband and I got married. My sex drive is very high but he approaches sex differently. While he does have a libido, he approaches sex with me the same way he would approach jacking off. It feels the same - like I am a full figured fleshlight. Also he finishes before I do, he always state that he is sorry and we can try again later but every session is the same. He doesn't take pleasure in pleasure, he just approaches it the way he would a job. He does say he wants me to finish as well, but usually that means he will just lay back and let me be on top while taking the time to catch some extra z's. I have tried to give him tricks and hints but to no avail. I could try to talk some more but I feel like it is fruitless to try and engineer a*\"desire\"* to please.

I would never have imagined that a relationship that is healthy otherwise would be damaged because of a sexual misalignment. But now that I am married and in my 30's it seems I want nothing more than an emotionally and sexually fulfilling sexual encounter . My husband is very traditional and conservative so there is not much flexibility. Admittedly, the relationship has its emotional deficits too. I am quite conservative myself.

{"prompt":"Short backstory, girlfriend and I have been dating for several years - recently moved in together.  She was a virgin when we started dating, I was not (and she knew that). I had several serious girlfriends prior, and had done a fair amount of experimenting - she hadn't. She also suffered from some body issues previously (very thin at one point, healthy but still thin now).\n\nI always thought at first she was just shy since she'd never had a serious physical relationship before, but after several years of dating (and sex) she is still pretty shy and uncomfortable about being naked. I took things extremely slow, tell her how beautiful she looks, ask her if there's anything I can do differently etc but it hasn't really changed much. We still have sex a few times a week, and she enjoys it (though certainly not \"loud\" or \"wild\"), but she rarely instigates, doesn't like being naked, etc.  Other than that we have a very healthy relationship and I know she loves me tremendously (and she knows I love her)\n\nIs there anything I can do to make her feel more comfortable? Or do I just accept that she will never be comfortable naked or the type to pounce on me randomly?  I feel like it's related to the body issues she faced but I'm hoping for some XX perspective (hence the throwaway account name...). \n\nThanks in advance!","chosen":"girlfriend is always uncomfortable with being naked when we have sex, is there anything I can do to help or do nothing?","rejected":"Girlfriend has had a very thin body before and is now very uncomfortable with her body, what can I do?"}

So the reason I want to end things is for one, I'm just not happy any more. We see each other about once a week and it has just started stressing me out instead of the opposite. She has started dealing with depression and actually gave herself bruises on her legs because she says she hates herself. I'm always extremely supportive but it's just stressful taking care of her all the time. She must call me once a day crying.\n\nMoving on. We have a trip coming up on the 11th. We have been planning this all summer, but as that date closes in, i feel more and more like I'm going to be miserable the whole time and it's just going to make it harder to break up later. I can cancel by the 7th with no fees or repercussions but i still don't know if I should. She has been saying things like, \"i don't know what I'd do without you\" and \"im so excited for this trip. Im just so sick of it here\" (we are living with our families until school starts again). It is all just making it very difficult to decide what to do.

{"prompt":"I'm a male and studying at University for nearly four years and I don't live at home unless it is the holiday periods. \nMy father has a very short temper and is very aggressive. He used to beat me, older brother and mother up when we were younger. Now he is older he wouldn't dare to try it now. He still has eruptive angry arguments where he will threaten to kill my mother or just shouts out her and tells her to get out of the house. I'm still dumbfounded that my brother and mother who still live in the house put up with this crazy behaviour. I have lived away for nearly four years on and off because of University and can't stand it when I'm living back with the family in the holidays.

That was a real crap example but I hope you understand that what I am justifying is he doesn't operate rationally as a human. He will never talk out a problem instead but will choose the angry approach every time which involves cursing and swearing and shouting as loud as he can. When he is unhappy with someone he will rant to another person about the other offending person's flaws and what he thinks they have done wrong etc (He always thinks he is right as well). I have not asked him if he will seek medical help for his issues because I know very well he will just get super pissed off. If I get him compulsory treatment how will that affect him and my family?

I guess the advice i'm after is whether or not you beautiful people think it's a good idea for me to take her up on the offer of going back to FWB's. I still really, really like her.

I kind of \"blew up\" on her, from what she says, and now she is convinced it will not work out in the long term. \n\nFrom the beginning I was kind of iffy on being with her because we had different beliefs. She views herself as a  Christian Scientist and I view myself as an Atheist. Her belief is that sickness is merely and illusion and can be corrected by prayer alone. She dislikes that I rely on medicine and science to cure my ailments. So, that is where our future comes into play. I want to vaccinate and take our future kids to the doctor and she does not (unless they are really sick). Her argument is that her family does not vaccinate and they are fine, so why should she inject her kids with diseases so they do not get those diseases? I try explaining to her, she has researched vaccinations, but she still thinks it is stupid. \n\nIn addition, she claims we are not compatible because we do not share similar interests. She watches TV with her dad, and reads books (vampire, erotica, sci-fi). I reddit and play video games. We met in college and we are in the same profession. We go to events and do other activities and when do we have fun together. My problems with her is she is openly racist and classist (her familiy is wealthy and she looks down on poor people, I grew up poor)\n\nI have suggested we see a relationship counselor, but she thinks the belief issues cannot be fixed, so she thinks a counselor would be of no assistance. She is afraid we will do nothing but argue and she is strongly against divorce, primarily because her parents are divorced.\n\nShe is a beautiful girl and she is very smart (other than the beliefs thing IMO).

Last night we had the talk, and while we do still care for each other, she just wasn't wanting to be in the relationship anymore and had felt that it had run its course. While it does suck on my end, there's not a whole lot I can do, and I really do think the best of her even right now. Chances are we'll see each other again, maybe even an occasional hookup if we're both single and feel like it, but our lives are going in two different directions and a relationship just isn't going to work.\n\nBut really, that's not the problem. The problem is that now I have to explain to folks that we've broken up, and I don't want to give them the wrong idea that it was a bad breakup filled with gnashing and weeping, laying in the fetal position listening to Nickleback. I really don't want people saying some bad shit about her when I mention that we've broken up, but I feel like it's going to happen when I say \"We've broken up\" and they'll just respond immediately \"Oh man, well she sucks, you're too good for her.\" At the same time, I don't want to come across as being hung up on her, and that's why I'm refusing to say anything bad because that's not true. The relationship has run its course, but I literally can't say anything bad about her because there's nothing bad to say.\n\nSo, what's the best way of letting folks know we've broken up, but without giving the impression I'm mad at her or that I'm still pining after her?","chosen":"GF broke up with me, I don't hate her but I don't want other people trying to comfort me by calling her a bitch, wat do?","rejected":"My girlfriend broke up with me, and I feel like I need to let folks know this without giving them the impression I'm still mad."}

{"prompt":"I always thought it was just my father doing things my father does. My younger siblings find it quite funny because they don't know how to react to it, and compare it to Gollum. \n\nHe's already seen a doctor and has been diagnosed with depression.

He also doesn't seem to view his behaviour as strange or unique in any way. \n\nHe's very intelligent, interesting, successful in his field (he works extensively with electricity, which may be why he makes verbal calculations about it, and often leaves random calculations scribbled in my notebook if I leave it lying around) and although he has a odd way of socialising, he makes many friends regardless. I don't know if it's worth trying to get him help or at least speak honestly with a doctor to try and get a diagnosis when it doesn't seem to particularly negatively impact his life.

In the old days, I never really noticed her, but lately I've kinda been fancying her. She never really stood out among her friends, but from small interactions that I've observed, she seems like she could be a really cool person when you get to know her.\n\nI haven't the faintest idea of whether she'd be interested, though.

I definitely don't want to ask her out right now because it would be Awkward City if she turned me down (I would still want to be friends with her and hang out if she's not interested in romance.)\n\nAlso, one of the other guys (Ted) seems to like her too, but I'm not sure if they have more of a brother\/sister dynamic.

{"prompt":"So I got called in to work today, which is awesome for me because I'm looking for all the hours I can get right now.

I stare at him for a moment, unsure as to whether or not he was seriously asking if I am putting eggs in an OMELETTE, one which he's seen me make numerous times by the way, and then I decide to call him out on his dumb question. He then flips out on my \"attitude,\" and rants on and on, all this over HIS dumbass question (No, I did not use the word dumbass to his face). Seriously?? \n\nAs well, he seems to be a lot more judgmental and close-minded then I thought he was when we first started going out. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him, constantly thinking about what he would say or complain about what I'm doing. More often than not, I'm right about what he's going to say, and it's always some form of criticism about what he thinks I've done wrong, whether he thinks I'm cleaning something the wrong way, or cooking something the wrong way (and I'm a great cook, I always get raving compliments on my food from others), to raising our child the wrong way, and on and on.

On one hand, we were broken up, she told me about it and was honest, and I really want to get back together with her. On the other hand, i don't want to be her backup plan.

{"prompt":"This happened last night. We had just moved in to our first home yesterday, and after a long weekend we finally got to just relax in our living room for the first time. At about 10:00pm my wife got a bit restless and wanted to go for a walk. We left our phones and keys at home because I just wasn't worried about anything in this neighborhood. \n\nAs it turns out, we have one of those fancy door knobs on the front door. When it locks, it will let you open the door from the inside but the door knob stays locked. I am only used to two types of door knobs, those that won't open unless you unlock them, or those that will automatically unlock if you open it from the inside. So we get back and I try to open the door and it won't open. We walk around the house hoping against hope that there's an open window, which of course there isn't. The back door (sliding glass) is locked with a door stop in the trench, and our garage door, which is not currently working was bolted shut. \n\nThe reality of the situation starts to set in that..we have only a few options. Wake up a neighbor on our first day moved in and ask to use a phone to call a locksmith, walk about a mile to the gas station to borrow a phone and call a relative so they can call a locksmith and save us some embarrassment, or break a window on the house we just moved into. We figured replacing a small window would be cheaper than a locksmith.\n\nStill in denial, we went back to the front door to see if I could twist the knob hard enough to force it open (lol). Not happening. Then my wife walks over to our security sign in the yard, picks it up, and uses it to pop open the door like you would with a credit card. Completely dumbfounded, the irony was lost to me until my wife pointed out that we broke into our house with our home security sign.","chosen":"Locked wife and I out of our house on our first night moved in. wife used security sign to pop open front door like you would with a credit card. hilarious.","rejected":"Locked wife and I out of our house due to not understanding door knobs.

He apologized and said that he meant I could be more \"studious\" (she had been working on a scholarship essay when she asked me to read it over for her, during which she and my boyfriend talked to each other).

{"prompt":"Repost from the anxiety subreddit, with an update at the bottom.\n\nFor starters, I have social anxiety disorder. I've been struggling with it since I was about 11 or 12. I'm now 24. For the most part, I was able to push through and pretend like thing were alright. I was able to deal with the fear and the stress and still function. But obviously with constant weight on my body every day.\n\nHowever something recently made my anxiety so much worse. I lost my pregnancy in the middle of September. Since losing my pregnancy, my anxiety has increased (not surprising). The problem is that it's gotten so bad that I now can't sleep without my boyfriend present. And if I do sleep, it's extremely choppy, split between fear as I'm awake, nightmares when asleep and an overall depressed mood. My boyfriend has a weekly ritual meeting with his group of friends for a project they've all been working on for a while. The meeting carries on into the early morning, so I do end up having to go to sleep without him. It's a day\/night that I dread.\n\nI feel like I'm losing myself because he is the only thing keeping me sane. I have to rely on him right now to keep myself from breaking. He's the only one who coaxes me back to reality when I have an attack, he makes me feel safe when he's around, I sleep so much better when I'm touching him. If I don't touch him, I'm bound to get nightmares.\n\nI apologize that this post is not very detailed, it's one of those nightly meeting nights, and I have to sleep without him.\n\n----------\nAs an update, it's the morning after. He crawled into bed an hour before I was suppose to get up for work. I couldn't face the world. I am absolutely terrified. Of what? I don't have a fucking clue. Everything. Nothing. It doesn't make sense, but it's happening. Being in a constant state of fear while not actually having a reason to be, warps my reality and literally makes me feel insane. I honestly feel I should be admitted. This isn't normal.

{"prompt":"I'll try to make this brief. I'm from the Midwestern United States if that helps. \n\nMy cat is about 7 years old and very active and loving. Recently I noticed she's been getting thinner and not eating or drinking water. I thought she was just being moody because I went on a business trip and my SO cared for her alone for the first time. After 2 or 3 days of this she started puking up yellow bile so I took her to the vet. \n\nSo, there is something wrong with her liver. I wish I could say exactly what but I was so upset when the vet was talking to me that I kinda shut him out until he got to the treatment options.

{"prompt":"I've had an OkCupid account for a couple months now. Met a guy who lives about an hour away who's a 40 year old PhD student (I'm 20). Anyhow, we had a successful date, and after an extended period of witty emails\/texts\/phone calls, we agreed that I'd spend the night at his place. He picked me up, we went back to his apartment and had dinner, etc. \n\nAt some point, he mentioned that he loved a UK tv show by the name of \"The Mighty Boosh,\" but that he had a hard time finding streaming episodes online. I had my laptop with him, so he gave me his wifi password and I torrented the three seasons for him. \n\nIn the morning, he gave me his USB drive so I could copy the files from my laptop. I created a folder called \"new folder\" and copied the files into it. While they were in the process of copying, I accidentally bumped the laptop and unsafely ejected the USB drive. When I re-inserted it, I used my mac search utility to search for \"new folder\" on the USB drive.\n\nA couple results showed up, and I clicked one. Suddenly, a stash of child porn. I'd say 13 pictures in total. Then, in a subfolder of that folder, another folder with more pictures that looked like child porn. None of these photos looked like they'd been taken by him, they looked like things he'd pulled off the internet. I looked at the image properties for one of the original 13 photos, it says the files were created in 1996. \n\nI copied the entire flashdrive's contents to my computer because I was about to go back home, and I didn't want to bring it up and then get stranded in a strange city with no way of getting back and little\/no cash. \n\nShould I say something?

{"prompt":"Our annual household income has averaged about $240,000 per year (varies slightly based on bonuses) the last 3 years.  We need to consider any tax efficiency we can, and we are already maxing out retirement accounts.  \n\nWe have saved enough cash to buy a new home.  It is a spec home and building will be completed early January 2017 and the purchase price is $458,000.  Our current home is worth $210,000 and we owe $160,000.  The mortgage is 15 year and we pay $1500 per month. (We still have $2,000 per month left over after all bills to save). Rather than sell, I am considering renting it.  A long term renter would probably pay $1700\/month to live in it.  I think I could revenue about $3000\/month via an airbnb rental (keeping in mind there are more costs like utilities, basic cable, cleaning, furnishing).  I haven't decided yet since I have to consult with a CPA on tax implications and such, but in general does this seem to be a decent idea?  I have set a \"make me move\" price on zillow in case anyone wants to make us an offer on the house sometime in the next 6 months.\n\nHere are some other costs of the property:\n$2,400 per year property taxes\n$900 per year homeowner's insurance\n4% interest rate on the $160,000 balance.  \nPurchase price was $190,000 5 years ago so depreciation would be $7600\/year based on the 25 year schedule.\nLawn mowning:  $700\/year\nelectric, gas, water:  $3,000\/year (this would be a write off if airbnb property I am assuming).\n\nAdvantages of selling the property would be getting about $40,000 to put into the new house or pay off a vehicle that has $800 per month payments.

My wife has been becoming friendly with the parent of our daughters' friend. This guy is just a real douchebag. I have nothing but dislike for him but our kids are friends. My wife has started to talk about him a lot. I know they text. I see her dress up way more than necessary when they are together. They are way too close and the relationship is really not one that makes me feel particularly great. \n\nIf she is cheating it would make me furious.

For the longest time, if I could cheat, I would. Nothing ongoing or with her friends but a large number of one night stands. My wife does know to a degree. I was caught once when we were dating and once more in 2005. We've since worked out our issues. \n\nI don't know if she has cheated on me in the past or not. I've never really got caught up on it since we lived really separate lives for a long portion of our relationship and to be honest I was very active on the side.

Last January I got injured and couldn\u2019t run for a while. The physiotherapist suggested going to the gym to train my core and back muscles. It turned out I looove lifting weights. I feel so badass doing overhead presses, and feeling badass makes me incredibly happy.\n\nI\u2019ve always been slim, especially my upper body.

Furthermore, \n\nhis university is two hours away however he comes home every weekend ( we don't live together but we're in from the same town) and since he doesnt have a car and there is no direct train connection, he is reliant on people giving him a lift. he could easily afford a car, he used to have one until it broke 3 years ago, however he prefers to spend his money on take out food, clothes and booze.

{"prompt":"About three years ago I was friends with a group of people, mostly guys. I don't really keep in touch with them anymore, but I'm still friends with one of the girls and she invited me to her wedding!\n\nWhen we were all friends three years ago, I ended hooking up with one of the guys. First time make-out, second time sex. Him and I were never really friends and never really talked before or after it happened. We generally avoided each other after it happened. As things tend to go everyone in the group eventually found out that we did it. While a tiny bit awkward, I don't really mind. If I ever hung out with the group after that, it became a joke.. something one or two people would quietly tease me about if we were drinking.\n\nFast forward to now! That group still hangs out but I'm not part of it. We will all be at the wedding. I'm pretty excited that I have a boyfriend I can invite and show off.

I could explain if that happens but wouldn't want him to think I was hiding anything or feel stupid for being in the dark about something other people know about. On the other hand, if I tell him, I guess I would just say that I hooked up with one of the guys but that we never dated and it wasn't a big deal. However, then I would have to point him out, or tell my bf his name, and he would likely be on the lookout for said guy during the wedding.

{"prompt":"OK in high school there was this girl I liked that I wanted to ask to our winter formal with the intent of dating her afterward.

So grudgingly I go to build a bear looking super out of place feeling really awkward just trying to buy a damn bear. So the next school day I wait before classes when we usually talk to ask her, and everyone is asking me \"what I have in the bag?\" So I show them and every one says good luck and stuff when my \"friend\" Vince walks up and sees that I was going to ask her out. So later I see him talking on the phone I immediately think he might be calling her, but then I think that's ridiculous and calm myself down. Little did I know she was sick that day. And the next day. And the next. So for three days I sit there in the morning with that bag waiting for her. Then one day I see her at lunch and present her with the bear and everything asking her.

We never ended up getting married. Without getting into specifics, she was emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive to me.\n\nI know I should have left earlier. That's not to say I didn't genuinely care for her. I loved her very much, but I knew her behavior was wrong. Her threats of suicide, self harm, infidelity, and false claims to police kept me from doing anything about it. Eventually it just because normal to me. Finally after one of her multiple week mean streaks I snapped.\n\nI put some of my things into garbage bags and moved into a motel. I tried for months to patch things up and get her to go to counselling with me, but all I got in return was bait-and-switch emotional abuse. Once I finally gave up I moved out of state to get away from her.  \n\nShe isolated me from all of my friends. She tried and failed to do the same with my family, who are very supportive and loving. I'm so thankful I have them, but I really have no friends or even acquaintances.

{"prompt":"I am a 19 year old male, in a 8 month relationship with a 19 year old female.  When I was young, my divorced mother had a few relationships with fairly shady men.  My father later told me he was worried about my sister getting molested.  Around the time she was dating the men, I started to have nightmares about getting molested, but always awoke and brushed it off as a bad dream.  I just started remembering these memories lately, and have spoken to my girlfriend about it.  \n\nI mentioned that I feared I was molested, because of \"new\" memories that feel sort of alien to me.  It's like watching bits and pieces of a movie, just snippets of images, although nothing outright damning.

I had a violent emotional reaction, and a rush of these snippets of images.  I am an empathetic person, and a very sensitive guy.  I told my girlfriend about this and sheepishly told her that I may have been, but am not sure.  She's been nothing of supportive, which I appreciate.\n\nI guess my real question is this:  I'm scared of facing the truth, but I'm also scared that I was never really molested, and that this is all just a creation of my imagination.

This continued right through the summer. \n\nThis September, we both began graduate programs and started to see one another less than we had before. In December, he broke up with me. Nothing big happened to cause the breakup aside from drifting apart a bit (which I felt was natural given our grad programs); I think that he just didn't know what he wanted in life.

{"prompt":"Hey there Reddit,\n\nHere's the deal. I've been living in an apartment for a about a year now. For the last 2 months or so, my upstairs neighbours (who I've never met) have had a dog living with them who occasionally goes outside onto their balcony (directly above mine) and pees. Our balcony floors are wooden slats, so some of it drips though onto mine.\n\nI'm not sure if it happens all the time because I work full time, but I think it might because sometimes I come home and their are very small puddles of liquid (which I'd presumed to be water) on my balcony, even if it hasn't rained. This being the case I think that they may have trained the dog to pee outside without really considering (or caring) that they've essentially trained their dog to pee on me.\n\nObviously this is not the greatest of situations, and I want to send them a note or contact them in some way so that it can stop. The only problem is that I don't really know how to approach it. I want to be firm and be clear that it's unacceptable, but also not come off as a busy body or too aggressive given that I've never even spoken to them before.\n\nHowever, there is one slight problem. My housemates and I have cats. They are both fully house trained (they only ever do their business in their litter) and are never allowed outside onto the balcony without one of us present. Our building doesn't allow pets, but our actual landlord said he didn't mind us getting some before we got the cats. I just want to be careful that I don't piss off the people living upstairs so that they don't rat us out for our cats and leave us so we have to get rid of them or move. I'm not even sure the people living upstair know we have cats since the cats are rarely outside, and we rarely see our neighbours outside either.","chosen":"Dog upstairs keeps pissing on our balcony.

We have lived together in the past for 2 years and currently for 2 plus years. Our current lease has the better part of a year remaining on it. I care for her greatly as a friend and we see each other as being very close almost like sisters. \n\nThe problem: We have some lifestyle differences (mainly in the housekeeping department) that in the past I have been able to live with\/overlook but lately I feel almost like I am taking care of a child and at some point it feels like I'm being taken advantage of although not intentionally. These things are impacting my life, my mental state,  and have even started to influence my behavior towards her. Bottom line its come to the point where it needs to be discussed. \n\nI understand that things should be brought up as they occur, as part of healthy friend relationship communication but her reaction to small requests can be quite over the top. So, I have pretty much avoided bringing things up because her reaction is basically a sort of punishment in and of itself.\n\nAdditionally, it has come to my attention that the care of her small animal is inadequate and its state of well-being is compromised.

We've gone out for some drinks and talked about life. She was always super encouraging. \n\nFor the program we have to complete an internship in order to graduate.

Cost about 100$ .\nWhen we were dating he did talk to me about how he doesn't really like diamonds because of where they come from [blood diamonds] and I totally understood. But I didn't really think he was THAT serious about the reason. It kind of made me wonder if he was just trying to cheap out or if he actually cared about the blood diamond.

Mind you , he does have the means to get a very nice ring.  \nI agreed with him and told him the marriage is what counts , who cares how much someone spends , it doesn't mean he loves me any less. \nAfter a year of marriage , my ring is now scratched on the diamond and it's obvious to the eye. So when I mentioned to him maybe it's time for a new ring, he said there's no way he's spending money on another one. \nHere's my thing, he's been engaged twice before.

Yesterday I had to buy something on ebay, so I used our joint paypal (We shared a lot of things, being brothers. Paypal was one of them. It seemed silly at the time to have different accounts since it would all go to the same address. Stupid on reflection, I know). I was curious and looked back through the history and found out that a few months before he moved he had taken my iPod and sold it on ebay. \n\nThis hurts, because he has always had money problems, yet every weekend he would drive four hours to see his girlfriend. No one in the family liked her except for me, and I often stuck up for my brother in family arguments. Now he's stolen from me. I don't even give a crap about the ipod, its just glass and plastic, but its the fact that I was living with someone that would do this to me, even after I was literally his only friend (excluding the gf, of course).

{"prompt":"Hi loseit, I'm wondering if I can find any help or motivation around here. A little back story for you before I explain where I am now:\n\nSince middle school, I've always been overweight. I was in the 180's for most of my teenage years, at 5'4\". I think the highest I got was about 185 and size 16 jeans. I was miserable. Went through all of high school never having even been on a date before. Went to prom alone, the whole deal.\n\nSo I decided to do something about it. My first year of college I lived at home, and had a great support system through my family that helped me to lose weight. I lost almost 40 pounds in 6 months, got down to about 147. It all kinda halted when that Summer I went on vacation with my mom, and ate whatever I wanted for 2 weeks straight, thinking I'd get back to the diet when I got home... no idea why I did that. Obviously, I did not get back to the diet. I have maintained for about 5 years at around 150 - 155, but I'm not happy with it.\n\nMy problem isn't that I don't know what to do with my diet, or what or how much exercise I should be getting, I know that stuff... I just can't figure out how to get down to my goal weight, which is around 125 - 130. I have a great boyfriend, I don't despise the way I look (just not in love with it), my life is pretty great, but... I just want to be healthy and NOT overweight for once. I've tried to get started again so many times, and have had success at first, but then I always just bounce right back and give up. I don't know how to get that motivation again to really STICK to my plan. I suppose the difference between now and then was that then I had a lot less temptations. I don't deal with temptations well.\n\nAny tips on motivating myself and avoiding temptation? I did do one cheat meal a week when I lost weight before and that worked, but for some reason I end up having multiple cheat meals, and then it just backfires. I would appreciate any advice. :)","chosen":"Lost weight 5 years ago, didn't make it to goal weight, having trouble finding the motivation.

{"prompt":"Our relationship was amazing at the start and I love this guy so much.\n\nWe have been dating for 5 months.\n\nOne month into the relationship he went to Australia for a month and while he was there he promised me that he wouldn't watch porn. I have a problem with porn because it is a horrible industry that degrades women, chews them up and spits them back out. I think that if he watches porn then that means I'm not enough for him.\n\nAbout a month or so after he got back from Australia, some of my friends were telling me how they thought it would be impossible that he's gone a month without watching porn. So I asked him, and he swore that he had never watched porn. I asked him numerous times over the next month if he had, always denying it. Then, one day last week I asked him again and he came out and confessed to watching it once about a month ago. That infuriated me because he obviously can't tell the truth to me. And worst of all he cheated on me with porn! \n\nI can't trust him anymore.\n\nWith this newfound untrustworthiness, I decided to look through his Facebook messages with his exes to see what else he was hiding or lying about. I found out that he had talked with his ex about gross things like rape, something about Japanese girls, and incest. (He said he wanted to fuck his cousin.) I got angry and called him out on this and he said he only said those things because his ex was a creep and he said those to make himself seem like her because he was insecure. \n\nI also found out hat he lied that his ex had been to his house.\n\nI told him it was over.\n\nI still love him though, I really miss the guy he used to be before I found out this stuff.

He wants it twice a week and I have a hard time getting in the mood a few times a month. He has said many times that a few times a month isn't enough for him. I don't know what to do because doctors have no fix to help me.\n\nWhen I force myself to let us have sex I hate it and am just waiting for it to be over. Little things (like the feeling of the hair on his legs or being freezing cold) take over in my brain and start to annoy me until I have to stop. When I'm not in the mood I really don't like how sex feels. Sometimes it becomes uncomfortable. I want our sex life to be enjoyable for both of us.\n\nAfterwards I am often left very angry because I am broken and I can't seem to enjoy what everyone else is able to. This anger starts to take over and is affecting how I feel about him overall (not just sexually).\n\nI have looked into seeing a sex therapist but I have not been able to find one that will accept our insurance and we can't afford to spend around $200\/hour without insurance.

{"prompt":"My friend never got a parenting plan in place right away after separating from her daughters father.  Now she's is struggling with him to agree.

This has worked up until dad decided to take a night job and doesn't get off until one in the morning. Mom has had daughter stay at her house during these times he works, but dad is showing up and trying to pick her up at 1am. Also note dad is trying to put her in a over night day care instead of allowing her to stay with mom. She has now filed in the courts and is awaiting mediation to try and reach an agreement. In Colorado, if he places her in day care over night what would stop mom from picking her up. Again there is no custody papers in place legally.  Also would it look bad on her in court if she does this.  My opinion is the child is better off with a parent rather than a third party, but again it was a verbally agreed parenting plan.","chosen":"friend separated from daughters father and is struggling to reach agreement upon child's residency. waiting for mediation to resolve custody, would it look bad in court if mom were to pick up child over night?","rejected":"my friend separated from daughters father without a parenting plan. have filed in court to reach agreement on child's residence. would it look bad in court if mom chooses alternate day care."}

{"prompt":"Hola dog lovers! I recently adopted a dog, [Eevee]( who is the sweetest and cuddliest little thing I've ever met.

We can tell she was trained by whoever had her last time, because she knows how to sit and [play dead]( and usually how to walk on a leash.\n\nSo my question involves something that happened with her this past weekend. We had her outside and were playing with her, letting her run in water from the hose. She had no problems, was loving the water on her and drinking from the hose. Then, someone flicked the hose like you do when you're trying to get someone far away from you wet. She freaked out! She ran to where the water landed, barked and ripped up grass roots and all!\n\nLater, someone was playing in the above ground pool. She did the same thing whenever water splashed over the side. There's wooden stairs and a platform leading up to the edge of the pool. When someone got out, and water dripped between the boards, she ran there and started digging out the stones they have surrounding the pool and barking some more.\n\nI don't think she's afraid of water because she is fine with baths, rain and the hose, and even went up on the platform and was trying to drink the pool water. I think she would've jumped in if I hadn't caught her.","chosen":"Dog freaked out\/barked\/manipulated water by barking and digging out the stones in the pool to get the water.","rejected":"My new dog ran away whenever someone stood in the water from the hose."}

I left school and went to sixth form (higher education) for a year doing Media, Film Studies and Business Studies which I later dropped out of as I got into a high standard engineering college to do an apprenticeship.

I did it for about 6 months before dropping out. \n\nI then moved onto a Graphic Design apprenticeship and got a placement at the best company in my area for design and marketing. I LOVED it! Until recently 4 Months into this apprenticeship my eczema skin condition has gotten so bad that it practically covers my full body and I am embarrassed to be out in public, I am not sleeping, I am in agony and I am beginning to become very very depressed.\n\nMy Skin condition seems to be triggered by stress and the job is VERY stressful at times and I'm beginning to think that it's not for me as it's not helping my health and I'm not enjoying it anymore because of this matter.

{"prompt":"Hello! This is my first post, I've been lurking for a while, sorry if the format comes out crappy(I'll fix it if it does). I have something I wanted to ask here since I haven't found any good answers while searching on google. \n\nI recently purchased a used 2012 Camaro from Carmax at the end of May this year. I was approved for a car loan from Carmax with a term of 60 months, a 5.90% interest rate and the interest is calculated as simple interest. The amount of the loan at the time of signing was just shy of $17K. I made the first payment the beginning on July(45 days after signing the loan). Currently I am paying an even $300 a month even though the actual amount due every month is ~$281, and the amount left is ~16K with the payments I've made(on-time) since buying the car. \n\nMy credit situation isnt terrible my credit history is just very young(~1 and 1\/2 years old). I dont have any student loans, old credit card debt, or outstanding medical bills. I also dont have any late or missed payments on my credit history. The only debt I carry besides the car loan is my 1 credit card from my bank(which I pay off in full every month). The credit card started out as a partially-secured card back in august of 2013, with a limit of $500. Approx. 4 months ago, they removed the partially-secured status, and increased my limit to $2k. I recently made an account on Credit Karma, and my estimated credit score is 696. \n\nNow on to my questions: Aside from saving money on interest, what positive and negative effects would re-financing the car loan have against my credit score? Is right now too soon to try and re-finance the loan? Should I wait until I've made more on-time payments to re-finance?\n\nI've started thinking about this recently especially after seeing re-financing offers on Credit Karma(not that I would apply without doing research) as well as offers from my bank to refinance the loan with advertised interest rates of 2.49% with a possible discount since I've been a customer with them for a while now.","chosen":"Bought car loan from Carmax, want to know if it's a good idea to re-financing, if so, how much to re-financing, and what negative or positive effects would re-financing the loan have against my credit score.","rejected":"I want to refinance my car loan, but I've never made a payment in the last 6 months.

We met through mutual friends and I asked her to accompany me as a as a \"date\" to a wedding, expecting to be nothing more than friends and didn't take it too seriously. To make a long story short, we had an amazing time together. I ended up sleeping over at her place that night. We fooled around a little but didn't have sex (which I am happy about--a girl that fucks on the first date isn't usually good relationship material and has low self-esteem, in my experience anyway).\n\nI had to leave the following day (this past Sunday) and return home.

Most girls I've dated have been more average in their personalities than me, which eventually left me bored.\n\nBasically what I'm wondering here is how to play my next move.

I'm a 23 year old female with no history of ear infections. 2 weeks ago I was using a Q-tip in my left year and I heard the weirdest noise and suddenly a lot of pain.

The following day I went to the CVS minute clinic that's down the street and the nurse prescribed me Neomycin,Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone ear drops. 4 drops in the ear 4 times a day. Basically, the infection got better but as time went on the severe ear pressure in said left ear got worse. I decided it was time to go see an ENT. The Dr. said the ear drops had built up in my ear. He then used a tool to clean out my ear-a little power washer type thing to clean out the ear with water. He said my right ear canal (the non infected one) was a bit red, but everything else seemed fine. He told me to come back if needed. 3 days later I was so frustrated, I decided to go back. He looked in both ears, noticed nothing was wrong, and then took me over to a machine to measure ear pressure. He said my left ear (the one that had been infected but no longer), had elevated pressure. He basically just told me to tough it out.
