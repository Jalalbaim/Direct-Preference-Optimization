{"prompt":"Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 7 months now, and it has been a blast since the very first day.

As far as I can tell, her main concern is that I have been intimate in the same ways with them as I have been with her.

I tend to be a little \"overly-attached\" at times, so I can't really object to this statement. It is not entirely impossible that I care for her the way I do simply because it's in my nature.\n\nHowever, I am positive that I have never been in love with anyone as I have been with my current girlfriend, and wouldn't want it all to end because of this.

{"prompt":"So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2\/28\/2011.","chosen":"Just bought a Garmin Forerunner 305 for a decent price.

{"prompt":"I'm going to start by saying I've (25f) been out of the dating game for about 3 years.

I met a man (26m) online a few weeks ago and we have just started seeing each other face to face. He is everything he seemed to be.

He has already said he's in no rush and is not pressuring me at all. In fact, we both have been very artful and skilled in letting up during our kissing when we notice the other getting too hot\/heavy.  \n  \nI've never been one to make out this quickly let alone have sex so soon, but fireworks are flying. In my gut, I feel like he could be a long term keeper and he has already expressed the same. He's ready to show me off to his family. So I don't want to do anything too quickly and possibly ruin our relationship's chances at going the distance.   \n  \nBasically, an opportunity is coming up this weekend. Its technically past the one week mark of us seeing each other face- to-face rather than just phone\/text\/email. We are connecting on every level and conversation flows freely.

{"prompt":"For the past few week my girlfriend has been wanting to go to a haunted house. She has asked my multiple times and I had curved the question by jokingly saying \"Yeah, only if someone holds my hand.\" And I even said that I'm not really into scary things.\n\nThe truth is that I have trouble coping with large amounts of anxiety and I barely even watch scary movies because of it.\n\nSo about a week ago I said I would go to a haunted house, at my girlfriend's request. Today, the day we were supposed to go, I told her I was nervous and I didn't know if I wanted to go. I told her I wouldn't enjoy the experience because of my anxiety, but I would still go if she wanted to. \n\nMy girlfriend seemed to take me confiding in her more as me letting her down than anything else. She started talking about how I should have said no to begin with, and why did I wait until the last minute to say I would be uncomfortable. \n\nI apologized and said if you really want to go, I will still go, but it just might not be enjoyable for me. She just shut down after this and is continuing to focus on me letting her down. \n\nI then suggested that we should still go out and do something, even if she wants to stay in because I wouldn't be comfortable at the haunted house. She initially rejected my suggestion, but eventually said, \"You plan what we'll do then. I just wanted to do something that we couldn't do any other time of the year. Where could we even go out to dinner that we haven't already been.\" (This is not verbatim, but just the gist of what she said)\n\nI understand I could have communicated more directly when she first brought up the haunted houses a few weeks ago. I take responsibility for that.  \n\nMy question is: What do I do now that my girlfriend is so disappointed that it almost seems like she's depressed? How do I make this into a good night, or is that not possible anymore?\n\nAny additional feedback unrelated to my primary questions is appreciated as well.

To make things worse one friend keeps obsessing over her in my presence and it hits at my underlying loneliness since I never had a true relationship. I feel like I need another group of friends to chill with but I don't know how to go about dealing with the consequences of such a move.","chosen":"Friend leaves the friendzone. Some go for her, I go for her too. I'm lonely and need another friend group.","rejected":"I'm a guy who's afraid of falling for a girl in group who's now twice as attractive and so I can't chill with her. What to do?"}

I was then serenaded by the lovely sounds of her screaming, \"Oh my f***** god!\" I half-jogged upstairs and saw her standing in the bathroom looking down into the tub. She told me, verbatim, \"Shadowheart321, I know guys have needs, but can you **PLEASE** keep it out of the shower and keep it in your room?\"\n\nI realized when I looked into the tub that we had just gotten a new drain catch and all of my nasty phlegm was stuck in it. I quickly caught on and started telling her that it wasn't what she thought and I was just really sick and I just had to blow my nose and it's not that, etc. She was listening to none of it and was still just staring into the tub with an appalled face on. As I bantered, my other roommate walked into the room to see what the fuss was about, and before I could even try to explain what happened, he looked into the tub and started absolutely hollering. In a last ditch effort to prove to them that it wasn't *that*, I leaned over, stuck my hand into the drain catch and scooped up some of my nasal droppings and told them to take a deep wiff of it. Then both turned out of the bathroom looking queasy as I stood there with a handful of mucus sitting in my palm. I will forever be known as the guy who picked up his own load from the bottom of the shower and told them to smell.","chosen":"blew my nose in the shower, roommate and other roommate saw, tried to prove that it wasn't that, ended up with a bunch of nasty mucus in my hand, will forever be known as the guy who picked up his own load","rejected":"blew my nose in the shower, roommate heard, went into tub to find out it wasn't that, ended up scooping up my nasal droppings and spewing them all over my hands and floor."}

{"prompt":"Hey relationship redditors,\n\nI have a quick and intriguing question about relationships in college. What would you do in this situation? It is kind of awkward once I really think about it. Here's my short story. \n\nI'm 20 years old in college. In our college's honor program enjoying life and utilizing my brain to the highest capacity. I've met some really cool people over the couple years at my college. I wasn't too interested in girl's at first, however I am comfortable around them now. I wasn't before. I still am a little reserved, but that's all worked out now. I've changed up my lifestyle and negative habits and I'm in college to be a doctor! Only black man in my honors philosophy course and everyone else is white. Representing the black community! We need to represented in these sophisticated classes! XD\n\nAnyway, I knew this really nice girl from last semester. We met in the hall after a random instance. I don't know how we got to know each other, but anyway I really like talking to her. However, she told me that she's not too interested in doing anything out. Like going out. She's pretty comfy where she's at now and doesn't want to date. She told me that she liked me, but doesn't want to do that type of thing. It's pretty understandable.\n\nShe has a sister and I can sense that she really likes me! 0.o. It is a weird feeling, but all I do is politely bob my head to say hi and she really lights up when she sees me. And I ended up eating lunch with her. It was a really good meal and we have similar interests. She's a vegetarian and was on a cleanse and ate some really good looking salad! That alone was very admirable! Because I thought, \"wow that's exactly what I'd do!\" She kind of hinted and have me good vibes, but I could be wrong.","chosen":"Met really nice girl in hall.

{"prompt":"hi, reddit,\n\nI've come here to ask a few questions... And thank you all in advance for reading.\n\nI'm a police officer, my boyfriend is a bartender. We've been together for about 3 years. We've had a lot of ups and some downs. \nWhen we first met (before I was in LE) we would frequently hang out at bars together. Now, I work night shift and my patrol area is a large group of bars where I basically deal with drunks constantly throughout the night.\n\nMy boyfriend is a bartender in that bar area. Lately he's been going out and drinking (mostly beer I believe) until about 1am give or take in this bar district. He does this while I'm at work over night. He does this about 3-4 times a week. \n\nSometimes it hurts my feelings because I work so hard in that area to do my job... Getting cussed, thrown up on, working car accidents, DWIs ect. It hurts me to think about my boyfriend hanging out and drinking at these bars while I'm working my butt off overnight.  If it was occasionally, I wouldn't mind. But it's several nights a week. \n\nI know my job is dangerous and I picked my career so I should deal with it. I don't feel like I deserve any special treatment but it also hurts when he decides to stay out and drink instead of coming by the house to say goodbye or anything at all before I go to work. I'm not saying be there every single day but... Maybe shoot me a text or something atleast.  \n\nI feel bad for letting it bother me, and I don't want to feel this way. I also don't know who he's with or when he'll eventually go home so that adds to it.. He knows my feelings on the situation but I feel that he does what he wants sometimes and will just brush it off or just apologize for it later.\n\nI don't want to nag him, he's a grown ass man... But at the same time, I'm not sure if I could have a potential future with him considering my career. \n\nIs this normal for guys to do and am I just over reacting?","chosen":"my boyfriend spends a lot of time drinking around bars when I work and it bothers me. Wondering what I should do\/ say to him to try and calm down\/ get things back on track?","rejected":"Boyfriend of 3 years is a bartender and often hangs out and drinks despite me working hard.

We never really hang out or anything, but we always greeted each other and talked for a bit if we saw each other anywhere.\n\nI got the number, even though it seemed like she wasn't too interested when she gave me it. She made an excuse when i called her to meet up, so i just figured she's not interested, but i can't just forget her, i'm in deep, even hearing her voice when i called her is like a drug to me. \n\nShe studies in a city about an hour away at the moment, which i will be going to with my friend. It's not because of her, we're going just to go out and party there, it's the capital here.\n\nWhich brings me up to my question.\nDo you guys\/girls think there is still a chance? Should i call her one last time when i'll be there and ask if there is a chance if she makes an excuse again or what?

She made an excuse when i called her to meet up, so i just figured she's not interested, but i can't just forget her, i'm in deep, even hearing her voice when i called her is like a drug to me. \n\nShe studies in a city about an hour away at the moment, which i will be going to with my friend. It's not because of her, we're going just to go out and party there, it's the capital here.\n\nWhich brings me up to my question.\nDo you guys\/girls think there is still a chance?

{"prompt":"Hey everyone. My roommate and I are coming to the end of 2 years of living together. Long story short, I will not continue to live with him beyond 2 years.\n\nWe used to work together and I thought he had his act together. Little did I know it was all a front. He hardly leaves the apartment besides to go to work, never buys household goods, barely cleans up after himself, and definitely doesn't do his fair share of things around the apt.\n\nHe's generally a nice guy but he's completely oblivious and can be really inconsiderate. For example we used to smoke (weed) together from time to time. I am for the most part cool with it. Then it started turning into 12 hour smoke sessions where he would sit in his room all day smoking. I eventually asked him to stop smoking inside, but slowly he started to again. Finally one night, I had had enough and I called him out and he's taken to smoking outside.\n\nSo here's what happened. At the beginning of the month he told me a friend of his needed a place to stay for a few days. I obliged under the agreement that she wouldn't be in the apt all day (I'm working from home and interviewing, speaking on the phone with privileged information, financials, etc.)\n\nHere we are almost two weeks later. She's been here almost every day. The one day she wasn't here, he had his FWB staying the night.\n\nI'm incredibly annoyed at this point. I texted him yesterday (as I knew I wouldn't be home when he was.) Yet he never replied. I texted him again this AM and still crickets.\n\nMy friends say I'm more upset than I should be, but I think my anger is justified. It makes more work for me (constantly emptying the dishwasher, trash I only take out, lack of any kind of alone time in MY own apartment.) I'm not sure what to do at this point. I know I have to confront him but I feel like such a nag with these situations he puts me in. Any type of advice for confronting this would be really appreciated.","chosen":"Roommate's random guest stays at my apt almost everyday despite clearly being an irresponsible bum.

{"prompt":"My 3 year old GSD x Husky rescue stayed with some relatives for a few days while my boyfriend and I moved house, and the relatives found an old choke chain to walk him with, instead of his Mekuti harness.

He hasn't pulled when on the choke chain at all, even when it was first put on apparently, so we think that is what he was trained on (and damage from that process is probably why his barks and whines sound a bit odd).

If he ever started pulling on the lead so that the choker was tight, I would stop using it straight away. The last thing I want is my dog being hurt.

I'm just worried about potential issues with the state of the house come that time and how much my deposit will be included in damages they do in the coming months.\nGetting the new guy (that's replacing me) to just give me the share of the deposit also doesn't exactly work, since we do not know how much of the deposit would be used in the current state of the house. When I move out it will be 2 years at that house.\n\nWhat should I do in this case?","chosen":"Moving out, roommates staying, I don't get my deposit back until everyone else moves out? What should I do in this case to avoid potential damages from the state of the house?","rejected":"Moving out, roommates staying, they are using the deposit from the current lease and I don't get my deposit back until everyone else moves out. What should I do?"}
{"prompt":"So basically there's this girl in my class whom I'm attracted to and I think that there is a chance that we could end up being a couple, but there seems to be a few things that can prevent that from happening. \n\n1.

{"prompt":"Background:\nI'm 21(F) and he's 25. He moved in with his old college room mates about a year ago, and they're a terrible influence on him. Before he moved in there, he used to go to the gym regularly, eat well, and go to church. Since he's moved in with them, he's gained about 30 lbs. To be fair, I've gained weight as well since we started dating, but it's mostly because I started at a University with a meal plan, and later on I could only afford cheap, less-healthy food. I've been trying to work with him constantly for both of us to go to the gym more, eat better, and go to church together.  He ends up going out to eat way more than he should (his friends all have good paying jobs and don't really care about their health, while he's still looking for a job in his field of study), and is just generally negatively affected by the environment.

After he sets everything up he starts raging because the DLC passport for multiplayer is region locked meaning he couldn't play online. Being a gamer myself i seem sorry because I know that's why he plays games but he then try's to exchange it with a game store in another CITY! Since I was getting tired I ask if I can stay at his place and he says yes. Come morning I fix the problem by logging in my account and downloading it on his ps3 he thanks me and plays it like there wasn't 1 hour of rage last night.","chosen":"friend got angry cause region locked DLC passport for online play was region locked, tried to exchange it and played it like there was no rage last night. what's the most ungrateful thing you ever see a person do ?","rejected":"friend get's a game he wants from me then goes apeshit when he can't play online due to region locking. thanks reddit for the awesome supportive comments! :)"}

But in the last couple of months I've come to a startling realization. \n\nGay men annoy me. \n\nIt's not hate, or discomfort. I'm against hate in any form, assuming a particular person hasn't done something to rouse my ire. I support gay marriage and consider myself an LGBT ally. I've had a lot of close gay friends - mostly through theatre - and I've kissed guys full on the lips in front of packed auditoriums 5 days a week without trepidation.

I like hanging out with women, and when you take the whole \"are we gonna bang?\" tension out of the picture it's relaxing as can be.\n\nIt's not the being gay that annoys me. It's the acting gay - acting *really* gay. Everyone knows what I'm talking about. It just seems disingenuous when someone's being as flamboyant as possible. I can understand it when someone's just coming out and feels the need to express their sexual identity, or in a pride parade - go wild, I say. \n\nBut when I see adult men acting like total queens, I just want to tell them to grow the hell up.

Blegh.\n\n**BUT.** I could totally be in the wrong here. I might just be an asshole. This bothers me.

{"prompt":"Hello, I need some help. My dog has a licking problem, one where she will continue to lick one particular spot. I've had her for a year and during this time, there is always one spot at a time she keeps licking, 4 in total so far, with one being here for months now on her front leg, fur is gone and it was infected before. She keeps licking until it bleeds, and when I find out I'll put ointment on it. I've been to the vet before because she seems to have developed an allergy to something randomly (started getting scaly skin and dandruff), but it hasn't been determined what it is yet (not food) and the licking issue, while brought up, wasn't really directly addressed. This is getting very stressful though, as my dad is also pressuring me to give her up to tend to my own emotional needs I'm trying to attend. I've tried to pinpoint if it may be something such as bordem, but I'm attending college, though not in school right now as it's summer and I currently don't have a job so I literally have spent months just her and me. I know it's not her \"fault\" but she keeps breaking my trust. If she's alone for literally 5 minutes, whether it's me showering or her going to her kennel after a walk and I'm in the living room she goes at it and then is afraid to see me because she knows how disappointed I get. I can tell whenever she does it everytime. I've tried wrapping it in every which way but she has torn everything off right after I leave her alone, and while I don't have an official E-collar, she has scratched off the homemade one as well silently, when she was sitting behind me.

{"prompt":"Hey Runnit. I'm having some trouble and I need a place to vent where people will understand my frustration. I've been out with a stress fracture in my tibia for the last 5 weeks.

By September 2010, [I was down to about 190] had a great job, great friends, and was really, really stoked.\n\nHere's where things get tricky.  Around this time, I started dating a super-excellent guy.  Our social circles have meshed effortlessly, and we spend a lot of time together.  He's a really picky eater, though, and doesn't like most of the stuff that I do (which is, coincidentally, the food that's helped me lose weight), so we end up eating out a lot.  Not only has my wallet taken a solid hit, I've gained about 15 pounds since we started dating.  Not enough to really *see*, but I'm definitely more sluggish, and it bothers me a lot.  On top of all this, I've become much more busy, now that I have a \"real\" job and I have an active group of friends.\n\nWhat do I do, folks?  I really don't know where to go from here.  I honestly don't know what a good goal weight for me is, and while I can work more activity into my life pretty easily, I don't know how to deal with the \"I'm always out, what on earth do I eat?\" problem.\n\nI'm sorry if this was weirdly-phrased and rambly -- I'll clarify if y'all have questions, but I really would love some help on how to get myself together again.","chosen":"25F, 5'6\", lost a lot of weight, dated super-excellent guy, gained some more weight since starting relationship, need advice on how to get back on track and stay healthy again.","rejected":"Started losing weight and gained 15 pounds since dating awesome guy, not sure where to go from here. Need guidance on what a good goal weight is so I can get motivated again."}
{"prompt":"I've been dating a girl going on two months now and we are both pretty happy.  Recently I was at an event without her and drinking with some friends but we got separated.  I ran into another group of people who I didn't really know that well and they started talking to me for a while.  \n\nWith the new people, one of the girls asked if I was planning on heading to a party at a particular house, and I said yes.  She followed me there and we had a bit more to drink.  Because I was pretty drunk the details aren't super clear, but I think she started to make out with me and I didn't stop her.  \n\nNext, she isn't feeling too well so I get her some water and crackers and call one of her friends who can take her home.  Her friend gets here and tries to get her to leave but she wants to sleep here.  I tell her friend it's ok, and that I'll sleep downstairs (I really did mean this).  The girl wants me to sleep with her though, so I do.  We lay there for a while, then make out a bit, then she keeps trying to get me to have sex and I keep avoiding it, but eventually it happens.  \n\nI've never cheated in a relationship before and I feel absolutely terrible for letting it happen.

{"prompt":"So I just came back from studying abroad and have been staying at my parents house until I move into my college apartment on Monday. The house is in a quiet town, kind of suburb-ish. The backyard ends with woods and hiking trails. \n\nAnyways, my 80 year old aunt said she had a litter of kittens living underneath her porch. The only human contact they had was her feeding them in the morning, which she couldn't afford to do for much longer. My sister and I went on July 14 and spent an hour luring one into a cat carrier. We surprised our mom and she was not too happy at first. Neither our mom, nor the kitten, would talk to us for 2 days haha. We discussed that the kitten was mine. I would be taking care of him and he'd be coming with me to my new apartment. Things got much better after 3 days. We discovered he was a boy kitty and I named him Caesar (I studied in Rome). He quickly became very sociable with humans and you could never tell he was ever feral. \n\nMy mom has had two male yellow Labradors since 2003 and a female cat since 2005. Caesar was scared of the dogs at first but now they love each other. The cat is another story. Caesar is a tiny energetic fur ball and always wants to play. He charges straight at her and she's just not about that life. They've never physically fought but she does hiss when he's nearby. For 10 years she always liked to go outside during the daytime to hunt smaller animals and chill with the dogs. I let her out yesterday morning and she hasn't been back since. She has a collar on but no phone# tag. \n I now have this looming feeling that she ran away because of Caesar. I hate that I'll never know for sure and he'll be moving with me in a few days.","chosen":"rescued a feral kitten from my 80 year old aunt. mom was not happy about it but now we suspect she ran away because of him. won't know for sure until lease is signed.

The only human contact they had was her feeding them in the morning, which she couldn't afford to do for much longer. My sister and I went on July 14 and spent an hour luring one into a cat carrier. We surprised our mom and she was not too happy at first. Neither our mom, nor the kitten, would talk to us for 2 days haha. We discussed that the kitten was mine. I would be taking care of him and he'd be coming with me to my new apartment. Things got much better after 3 days. We discovered he was a boy kitty and I named him Caesar (I studied in Rome). He quickly became very sociable with humans and you could never tell he was ever feral. \n\nMy mom has had two male yellow Labradors since 2003 and a female cat since 2005. Caesar was scared of the dogs at first but now they love each other. The cat is another story. Caesar is a tiny energetic fur ball and always wants to play. He charges straight at her and she's just not about that life. They've never physically fought but she does hiss when he's nearby. For 10 years she always liked to go outside during the daytime to hunt smaller animals and chill with the dogs. I let her out yesterday morning and she hasn't been back since.

However someone told me that i was leaning against him on the couch and she wasnt sure but he may have been kissing my neck.\n\nI felt absolutely disgusted after I found this out. I had a huge talk with my friend and she thought it was best for me not to mention it to my boyfriend because it was a new relationship and I had been adamant that I didn't want to hook up with him. I didn't say anything to him.\n\nI hadn't really thought about it much until recently. About six months ago I came to terms with the fact that I have an alcohol abuse problem. I've been sober now for three months. I've been seeing things much more clearly now and this event is really starting to bother me. \n\nI know nothing like this will ever happen again, because I am confronting my problem, and I'll never let myself be in that state again. I can't. \n\nMy question is, do I talk about this with my boyfriend or will it cause too much unwarranted pain now that it's been so long?","chosen":"Got too drunk, might have kissed someone else. After addressing alcoholism I don't know whether I should tell my bf.","rejected":"Kissed someone else while blackout drunk. Worried I will do something similar again. Should I talk to my BF about it or leave it?"}

{"prompt":"We've had one Sphynx cat for about 4 months now, and noticed he seemed to get lonely alone, so a week and a half ago we got a second Sphynx cat (about 20% larger, and a year older).  They were fine, socializing since the day we got them, with a decent amount of play fighting that would occasionally get a bit rough, which we would break up.\n\nEarlier today, I was in the kitchen feeding them and as they swirled around my feet, I accidentally stepped on the smaller cat (which we've had longer).  He let out a squeal, and the two cats started going at it.  We separated them into different rooms, and tried to \"re-integrate\" them after about an hour, and they were both still hostile.  We tried again after about 2 more hours, and the same thing happened again.  This time we isolated the newer cat in the bedroom and gave our first cat run of the apartment.  They stood at other sides of the same door and meowed (loudly, and sounding angrily) back and forth, which got progressively louder until we took one cat away.\n\nIs there something we should be doing to remedy this?

{"prompt":"So I'm a hedonist or rather a complete trainwreck; I'm a college dropout who went into mediocrity for the simplicity it offered (also a variety of drug related convictions, chiefly opiate related) and live in a \"rapidly gentrifying neighborhood\" (shady, sketchy and shitty) near a medical college. I'm 22, I've been living in a three apartment townhouse for 3 years, every year around June the leases expire and new leasers occupy the other two apartments; I generally don't pay attention as my landlord is a slum lord and we have a mutual desire to be left the fuck alone; my life constitutes of working and getting high at home, life passes me by. Anyway about two weeks ago I nodded off in front of my apartment's door and I wake up being observed by this Indian chick who woke me up, got me inside and layed me on my side.

I really didn't want to talk to the lady, and eh, I could buy new slippers. I had just a few seconds before she approached; the shock of the flying shitty slipper was still with her. I committed, and ran\u2014 nay, wobbled like a penguin wearing one slipper. This still isn't over. The handles of one of the bags tore. It fell off. I lost my wobble-rhythm and the other one fell too. I lost my balance and fell with it. I just left all the stuff there and sprinted home.\nI don't know what I'm going to tell my mom.","chosen":"TIFU by throwing my shitty slipper at an old lady.

{"prompt":"I've been very good friends with my friend, Chris, for 4 years. We met through my ex and we've always had a completely platonic friendship (I was also good friends with his ex-wife at the time). He's been in a relationship with his current girlfriend (Angela) for about a year and a half. For numerous reasons, I've only met her once about a year ago and she was very sweet and friendly. Since then we haven't seen each other because she travels for work and that's when Chris and I catch up; additionally, she has her own social life and on days when she wants to be alone with her friends, he and I will grab dinner. She never has a problem with that as far as I know.\n\nAnyway, I went out with Chris, Angela, and another couple on Saturday and when we were exchanging hello's she just glared at me. No response. I was shocked, but I thought she was in a bad mood and let it go. Throughout the night, however, she ignored me and didn't even look in my direction once. She was bubbly and friendly to the other couple but excluded me. When I did address her at one point (trying to be civil) she merely glared again and didn't respond. \n\nThe next day, I asked Chris what happened. He acknowledged that even the other couple noticed what was going on and texted him about it at the table. I assumed that he and Angela must have discussed it, but apparently he didn't raise the issue at all. I was shocked and hurt, and he defended his decision not to ask because he has bigger priorities now (they're having problems-- no wonder). This is out of character for him.\n\nI've never done anything to warrant this type of treatment and I'm concerned because we'll be at the same event in a couple of weeks hosted by his brother. I feel like I deserve an explanation, or at the very least, someone should raise the issue with her.\n\nHow do I discuss this again with Chris? :(","chosen":"My friend went out with his girlfriend and introduced her to me and other friends, and now she's ignoring me.

{"prompt":"So I broke up with my SO about 4 months ago - it was the cleanest possible breakup, due entirely to conflicting schedules and lack of time, so there was really no impetus for me to move on.

{"prompt":"My apartment building has a very strange phenomenon where people will just sit in their cars for extended periods of time.  Why?  I have no fucking clue.  This one lady I know for a fact lives there and I see her every afternoon sitting there when I pull in after work, and still sitting there a half hour later after I take a shower.  The building faces the ocean, but these people choose to back into the parking spot so they are facing the building, middle of winter so it's cold as balls outside, and just sit there.  Doing who the hell knows what.  It's so weird.\n\nAnyway one morning I wake up and my roommates rockin a piss already.  It's one of those mornings where I simply could not wait 30 seconds for him to finish, I had to piss *now*.  I did the only logical thing and swung open the sliding door to the deck (that faces the parking lot\/ocean) and do my business in the warm doorway, giving that dirty deck a nice golden shower. \n\nThis happened at 6:15 am.  Before I pissed everywhere I was careful to check out the lot.  Every single car was off.  There was no wind; it was silent. I was sure no cars were running.  I scanned each car individually and they all appeared totally empty.  Perfect, open the flood gates.\n\nBut as fate would have it, on the one god damn morning I decide to piss out the deck door, halfway through my business some lone motherfucker just swings his car door open and hops out like it's nothing out of the ordinary to sit in his car at 6:15am doing literally nothing.  I had my pants pulled down just enough to reveal just my dick; I don't even care if he saw it.  I cared more about cutting off the flow and not dribbling all over the inside rug for fuck's sakes.\n\nWhat the fuck though, does anyone else experience this?

{"prompt":"When my girlfriend and I started dating 7 months ago, she mentioned she had a crazy stalker ex who was still crazy over her and would call\/text her once in a while although she said she wouldn't reciprocate. I didn't think much of it.\n\nThis past weekend she told me that this guy tried calling her saying he would try to break up our relationship. When I asked her the reasons why he would want to do that, she was not straightforward with me and I felt something was up.\n\nSo I found the number of the other guy and called him up.

{"prompt":"This has been a problem for me ever since I started wanting to lose weight - I started taking birth control and gained weight back to my highest, which really is only 30 pounds over my GW and technically not even overweight. \n\nMy mother, father, and sister are all overweight - my sister unfortunately did not get my genes, and has been this way all our lives despite eating basically exactly the same as I did.

{"prompt":"I'm wondering how to handle this situation and if my GF is really ready for a relationship based on some of the things I have seen.

I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. \n\nThat said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.\n\nI don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks.

I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. \n\nThat said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.\n\nI don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her. During the day\/evening she will be flirty and talking about all the stuff we're going to do in bed, and then after I get out of the shower and she's been on his Facebook, it's like she's emotionally unavailable the rest of the night.\n\nI really love her though so I want to try and make it work, it's just I'm not sure of the right way to handle this situation.","chosen":"GF is secretly checking her ex's facebook every night and crying over it; I'm unsure of the best way to handle this situation, and I'm scared it's not over yet.","rejected":"GF is secretly checking her ex's facebook every night, texting\/crying once a week. I don't know if she's ready for a relationship based on some of the things I've seen."}
{"prompt":"I'm a 23 year old female who's been single for the past 3 years.  My last relationship ended badly and I basically lost all desire for love and commitment.  Just to understand what issues I am dealing with I should explain that he had no job, didn't graduate from high school, didn't pay or offer me anything but I was young and in love so it didn't matter.  \n\nAnyway, since then I've become a bit of a lone wolf.

{"prompt":"Hello reddit. Sorry for the throwaway, my boyfriend (m27) is the one who introduced me to reddit, so I'm sure he'd find this post if I used my real account. \n\nMy SO and I have been dating for a year and a half. We met at work and saw each other pretty much everyday. Recently he took a new job about 200 miles away so we see each other about every 3 weeks.\n\nMy dilemma is that he WILL NOT talk about the future. Ever. Not at all. Nothing. And it's hard to be in this LDR without any plan of physically being in the same location again or even knowing that thats something we both want. When we were with each other all the time the future didn't seem to matter as much. But now that he's gone and we're trying to stay together I feel like I need some reassurance as to WHY we're engaging in a LDR with no foreseeable end. Some reason that it's worth doing it.\n\nI have tried talking to him about it. He mentioned that he didn't want to be one of those people who start taking the next step in their relationship because they reach a certain age. He also said he can't tell me he knows he wants to be with me because he doesn't know, and that he doesn't know what will happen in the future. \n\nI just don't know if this is a waste of my time and energy. I know that if it was one of my friends asking me for advice I would tell them to let him go and move on if he can't make up his mind about you. But for some reason it's harder to see when it's your own life. I know he loves me and I know he's indecisive about almost everything else. Maybe he's taking me sticking by him for granted? I just don't know.\n\nSo should I stay or should I go? Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.","chosen":"SO of 1.5 yrs won't talk about future which makes it hard to be in LDR without knowing if we'd actually stay together.

{"prompt":"Ok, heres the story:\n\nI was flying from Fortaleza (Brazil) to Stockholm (Sweden) with a connection in Lisbon on Monday evening. Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule.

We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us \"We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there.\" There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer \"You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!\" (in portuguese). \n\nThats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: \"You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away.\" I said it would be illegal of me to publish it but Im filming it to myself and I can do it.

{"prompt":"I've been dating my SO for 2.5 years, all long distance. I don't want to emphasis our issues as I've already made my decision. But I don't know how to execute.\n\nHe's been emotionally abusive and manipulative to me for the last 6 months. It's become unbearable. He plays mind games. He's emotionally and physically cheated on me. He would ignore me for days, weeks as punishment. He would break up with me and when I would plead, he'd take me back. Long story short, it's a very unhealthy relationship.\nI've been through some traumatic experiences with men, particularly him. I'm wondering if it's okay if I just disappear. I don't have the courage nor the strength to officially end things with him. I will get pulled back in. He doesn't love me. He doesn't care about me. He just likes the affection, my attention, and the feeling of control. He wants me to chase. I quit. Is it okay if I just block everything without saying a single word about it?

{"prompt":"I have been dating my boyfriend for about 2 years now. We met online and had instant chemistry. We had a rocky start because he is very progressive and I am extremely old fashioned. The first time he told me he loved me was, I think, more of a cover up for the fact that he also revealed he'd gotten a girl pregnant just before dating me. He told her he didn't want anything to do with it and that I was his priority. Probably my first indication to run. \n\nLater I found he had been talking to ex's back in his hometown(very far away from where we are) and I wanted to call it quits at that point. I decided not to because I had already fallen in love with him and trusted him when he said he's change. \n\nDon't get me wrong, he makes me ecstatically happy, otherwise I wouldn't have stayed. We talk about marriage and children a lot. Now we have picked up our lives and moved together to an entirely new city so that we both could have better jobs, but I think I need a fresh start and probably a break from men who do not know what it means to be exclusive. Also I find he texts women from work more often than he should. He has a lot of female interaction on his job and I don't trust him with it. This is what sparked my post.","chosen":"Moved to new city with boyfriend due to career\/work needs. Had rocky start.

{"prompt":"I had a book when I was a kid in the early or mid 80s ... about a cat that has a bad habit of eating shoelaces.  It tells a moral story about gluttony\/overindulgence and the cat gets bigger and bigger.  I think it also ate typewriters, or maybe just the keys.  The cat's parents are involved at some point.  The cat is reproved -- maybe by a doctor? -- who convinces the cat to eat such treats in moderation.  There might have also been turnips?? but I might be confusing the turnip part with a different book.  The book ends with the cat losing weight, and he only *occasionally* indulges in a typewriter key.   I remember the drawings -- a cat with shoelaces hanging all out of its mouth, and I think there were a variety of typewriters and different-looking keys.  To my recollection the drawings were black and white, pen-style.  Obviously this book left an impression on me.  I was hoping to give it to my nephew as a present, but I can't find it anywhere.  You would think the terms \"cat\", \"typewriter\", \"shoelaces\" aren't usually combined and would easily point to something.
