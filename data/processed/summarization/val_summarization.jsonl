{"prompt":"Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 7 months now, and it has been a blast since the very first day.

As far as I can tell, her main concern is that I have been intimate in the same ways with them as I have been with her.

I tend to be a little \"overly-attached\" at times, so I can't really object to this statement. It is not entirely impossible that I care for her the way I do simply because it's in my nature.\n\nHowever, I am positive that I have never been in love with anyone as I have been with my current girlfriend, and wouldn't want it all to end because of this.

{"prompt":"So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2\/28\/2011.","chosen":"Just bought a Garmin Forerunner 305 for a decent price.

{"prompt":"I'm going to start by saying I've (25f) been out of the dating game for about 3 years.

I met a man (26m) online a few weeks ago and we have just started seeing each other face to face. He is everything he seemed to be.

He has already said he's in no rush and is not pressuring me at all. In fact, we both have been very artful and skilled in letting up during our kissing when we notice the other getting too hot\/heavy.  \n  \nI've never been one to make out this quickly let alone have sex so soon, but fireworks are flying. In my gut, I feel like he could be a long term keeper and he has already expressed the same. He's ready to show me off to his family. So I don't want to do anything too quickly and possibly ruin our relationship's chances at going the distance.   \n  \nBasically, an opportunity is coming up this weekend. Its technically past the one week mark of us seeing each other face- to-face rather than just phone\/text\/email. We are connecting on every level and conversation flows freely.

{"prompt":"For the past few week my girlfriend has been wanting to go to a haunted house. She has asked my multiple times and I had curved the question by jokingly saying \"Yeah, only if someone holds my hand.\" And I even said that I'm not really into scary things.\n\nThe truth is that I have trouble coping with large amounts of anxiety and I barely even watch scary movies because of it.\n\nSo about a week ago I said I would go to a haunted house, at my girlfriend's request. Today, the day we were supposed to go, I told her I was nervous and I didn't know if I wanted to go. I told her I wouldn't enjoy the experience because of my anxiety, but I would still go if she wanted to. \n\nMy girlfriend seemed to take me confiding in her more as me letting her down than anything else. She started talking about how I should have said no to begin with, and why did I wait until the last minute to say I would be uncomfortable. \n\nI apologized and said if you really want to go, I will still go, but it just might not be enjoyable for me. She just shut down after this and is continuing to focus on me letting her down. \n\nI then suggested that we should still go out and do something, even if she wants to stay in because I wouldn't be comfortable at the haunted house. She initially rejected my suggestion, but eventually said, \"You plan what we'll do then. I just wanted to do something that we couldn't do any other time of the year. Where could we even go out to dinner that we haven't already been.\" (This is not verbatim, but just the gist of what she said)\n\nI understand I could have communicated more directly when she first brought up the haunted houses a few weeks ago. I take responsibility for that.  \n\nMy question is: What do I do now that my girlfriend is so disappointed that it almost seems like she's depressed? How do I make this into a good night, or is that not possible anymore?\n\nAny additional feedback unrelated to my primary questions is appreciated as well.

To make things worse one friend keeps obsessing over her in my presence and it hits at my underlying loneliness since I never had a true relationship. I feel like I need another group of friends to chill with but I don't know how to go about dealing with the consequences of such a move.","chosen":"Friend leaves the friendzone. Some go for her, I go for her too. I'm lonely and need another friend group.","rejected":"I'm a guy who's afraid of falling for a girl in group who's now twice as attractive and so I can't chill with her. What to do?"}

I was then serenaded by the lovely sounds of her screaming, \"Oh my f***** god!\" I half-jogged upstairs and saw her standing in the bathroom looking down into the tub. She told me, verbatim, \"Shadowheart321, I know guys have needs, but can you **PLEASE** keep it out of the shower and keep it in your room?\"\n\nI realized when I looked into the tub that we had just gotten a new drain catch and all of my nasty phlegm was stuck in it. I quickly caught on and started telling her that it wasn't what she thought and I was just really sick and I just had to blow my nose and it's not that, etc. She was listening to none of it and was still just staring into the tub with an appalled face on. As I bantered, my other roommate walked into the room to see what the fuss was about, and before I could even try to explain what happened, he looked into the tub and started absolutely hollering. In a last ditch effort to prove to them that it wasn't *that*, I leaned over, stuck my hand into the drain catch and scooped up some of my nasal droppings and told them to take a deep wiff of it. Then both turned out of the bathroom looking queasy as I stood there with a handful of mucus sitting in my palm. I will forever be known as the guy who picked up his own load from the bottom of the shower and told them to smell.","chosen":"blew my nose in the shower, roommate and other roommate saw, tried to prove that it wasn't that, ended up with a bunch of nasty mucus in my hand, will forever be known as the guy who picked up his own load","rejected":"blew my nose in the shower, roommate heard, went into tub to find out it wasn't that, ended up scooping up my nasal droppings and spewing them all over my hands and floor."}

{"prompt":"Hey relationship redditors,\n\nI have a quick and intriguing question about relationships in college. What would you do in this situation? It is kind of awkward once I really think about it. Here's my short story. \n\nI'm 20 years old in college. In our college's honor program enjoying life and utilizing my brain to the highest capacity. I've met some really cool people over the couple years at my college. I wasn't too interested in girl's at first, however I am comfortable around them now. I wasn't before. I still am a little reserved, but that's all worked out now. I've changed up my lifestyle and negative habits and I'm in college to be a doctor! Only black man in my honors philosophy course and everyone else is white. Representing the black community! We need to represented in these sophisticated classes! XD\n\nAnyway, I knew this really nice girl from last semester. We met in the hall after a random instance. I don't know how we got to know each other, but anyway I really like talking to her. However, she told me that she's not too interested in doing anything out. Like going out. She's pretty comfy where she's at now and doesn't want to date. She told me that she liked me, but doesn't want to do that type of thing. It's pretty understandable.\n\nShe has a sister and I can sense that she really likes me! 0.o. It is a weird feeling, but all I do is politely bob my head to say hi and she really lights up when she sees me. And I ended up eating lunch with her. It was a really good meal and we have similar interests. She's a vegetarian and was on a cleanse and ate some really good looking salad! That alone was very admirable! Because I thought, \"wow that's exactly what I'd do!\" She kind of hinted and have me good vibes, but I could be wrong.","chosen":"Met really nice girl in hall.

{"prompt":"hi, reddit,\n\nI've come here to ask a few questions... And thank you all in advance for reading.\n\nI'm a police officer, my boyfriend is a bartender. We've been together for about 3 years. We've had a lot of ups and some downs. \nWhen we first met (before I was in LE) we would frequently hang out at bars together. Now, I work night shift and my patrol area is a large group of bars where I basically deal with drunks constantly throughout the night.\n\nMy boyfriend is a bartender in that bar area. Lately he's been going out and drinking (mostly beer I believe) until about 1am give or take in this bar district. He does this while I'm at work over night. He does this about 3-4 times a week. \n\nSometimes it hurts my feelings because I work so hard in that area to do my job... Getting cussed, thrown up on, working car accidents, DWIs ect. It hurts me to think about my boyfriend hanging out and drinking at these bars while I'm working my butt off overnight.  If it was occasionally, I wouldn't mind. But it's several nights a week. \n\nI know my job is dangerous and I picked my career so I should deal with it. I don't feel like I deserve any special treatment but it also hurts when he decides to stay out and drink instead of coming by the house to say goodbye or anything at all before I go to work. I'm not saying be there every single day but... Maybe shoot me a text or something atleast.  \n\nI feel bad for letting it bother me, and I don't want to feel this way. I also don't know who he's with or when he'll eventually go home so that adds to it.. He knows my feelings on the situation but I feel that he does what he wants sometimes and will just brush it off or just apologize for it later.\n\nI don't want to nag him, he's a grown ass man... But at the same time, I'm not sure if I could have a potential future with him considering my career. \n\nIs this normal for guys to do and am I just over reacting?","chosen":"my boyfriend spends a lot of time drinking around bars when I work and it bothers me. Wondering what I should do\/ say to him to try and calm down\/ get things back on track?","rejected":"Boyfriend of 3 years is a bartender and often hangs out and drinks despite me working hard.

We never really hang out or anything, but we always greeted each other and talked for a bit if we saw each other anywhere.\n\nI got the number, even though it seemed like she wasn't too interested when she gave me it. She made an excuse when i called her to meet up, so i just figured she's not interested, but i can't just forget her, i'm in deep, even hearing her voice when i called her is like a drug to me. \n\nShe studies in a city about an hour away at the moment, which i will be going to with my friend. It's not because of her, we're going just to go out and party there, it's the capital here.\n\nWhich brings me up to my question.\nDo you guys\/girls think there is still a chance? Should i call her one last time when i'll be there and ask if there is a chance if she makes an excuse again or what?
