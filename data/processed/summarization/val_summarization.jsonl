{"prompt":"A year ago I had a vague, pipe-dreamy idea for an interesting software project - a way of visually mapping politics in a procedural way.

It has to be free and open-source if it's really to meet its potential.

I'm not sure I would be comfortable making money off this project, even though it will take skills, I think these exist in the public domain of willing volunteers.\n\nI realise I might end up explaining the whole thing, which is a big job, and I *will* do if necessary in an edit.","chosen":"I have an idea for a pro-accountability software project that I want to bring into the open, but don't know where to start.","rejected":"A year ago I had a vague idea for a software project and now I'm developing it as a commercial product and I want to know where to start discussion."}

{"prompt":"I'm completely at a loss & could use some advice.\n\nBasically, my girlfriend started taking a new, significantly stronger birth control pill to regulate her period about 3 months ago. 3 weeks ago she said she feels she's fallen out of love with me & wants to end things. She said it's nothing I've done & that she's \"afraid of hurting me\" & she's had \"an uneasy feeling about the relationship recently\". \n\nOur relationship had been amazing up until this point.

As a result she doesn't have a 9-5 job, doesn't earn much money, and really, really needs health insurance.\n\nOur state didn't expand Medicaid, and my employer offers health insurance but it would cost an arm and a leg to cover her with it. She qualifies for subsidies on the market as long as we can bust our asses and keep her income high enough.\n\nThe trick is she would lose those subsidies if she has any other way to get coverage - i.e. my employer.

I am truly attracted to her but when the condom became an issue I took it off and it was great, stayed hard, made her orgasm.

We danced (near each other, not with each other *awk me*), talked a lot, shared some laughs, and generally got to know each other. Peachy. So when I dropped her off, the awkward hit like a sack of bricks in the face. I suddenly got nerved up and I think I came across as just...completely uninterested. So parting ways I think I said something ambiguous and unromantic like \"See you around\". There was this instant wipe of disappointment and then she said \"Can I at least get a hug?\" and I happily obliged but...it kind of threw off my entire view of the night.

So we went to the emergency room to have her examined and what the fluid turned out to be was cerebrospinal fluid. So the fluid surrounding her brain was leaking causing it to sink on her brain stem and she began to have low pressure headaches.\n\nThey put a drain into her spine to help relieve pressure off of the leak in her skull, but during the procedure the tech had missed his entry point and had mistakenly herniated one of her discs.

Sure, many have factors in their lives which cause them to feel this way, but many are genetically predisposed to the condition and no scenery change or 'opening up' will change that.\n\nGo to a counselor (not a psychiatrist) to determine whether your problems are psychological, and a GP to determine whether it is at all related to any physical issues that you may have (allergies, diet, et cetera). Go to a specialist at the recommendation of your counselor and GP. Starting with a specialist can be problematic, first because it may cost you unnecessarily, and second because, at least in my experience, someone who limits their field of work can sometimes limit their field of vision. Unnecessary treatment and incorrect diagnosis kind of suck. So, start out with a wide view, and work your way toward a more focused treatment.\n\nDon't just wait for it to get better, and don't expect the world to get better with a change of location.

A little background, we live in the UK, my GF lives in a different city to me due to our work, and 3 months ago started working at a new post. What I'm about to write is what I've heard from her.\n\nShe went out for a Christmas party with work colleagues and as usual involved dinner and drinks\/clubbing. At the end of the night she and her senior (A), who has a higher position, married with children, offered to walk her home. She agreed as she was a bit drunk at this point.\n\nPrevious to this she has talked about A as a mentor who has guided her through the new job an given her some good career guidance. Needless to say she trusted him as a friend.\n\nAnyway, once they were at her home he started making very aggressive advances including trying to remove her dress, kissing her & inappropriate touching. All the while she was saying 'Stop, this isn't right, you have a wife' etc. She made it quite clear about this. He continued and at one point he had removed his pants and was trying to get her to perform oral sex on him. Again she refused and he left shortly after. \n\nShe is extremely upset about this and doesn't want to report it to HR or the police as she doesn't want to relive it and would rather forget about it and try to move on, she believes this will give her closure. I can completely understand but to me the situation is much worse then she is giving off and this needs to be reported to their HR department at the very least.\n\nSince the night occurred she has only told a couple of friends (who do not know A) and me. One friend has told her not to do anything about it and says things like this happens, to me this is completely the wrong thing to say and trivialises the situation. \n\nAt the moment she is very upset and angry, (as am I, I feel by not being there I can't do anything) and would rather forget about what happened.

{"prompt":"Story:\n\nMy dad's mom passed in July. He and his brother are to split her estate and all things included in it 50\/50. They both agreed that I can have her 2009 Lexus RX350. I will receive it on Saturday. I plan to sell it at some point in the near future and combine the money from that sale and the money from the sale of my own vehicle to buy a newer vehicle.\n\nQuestions:\n\nPart 1: I read that Washington State has no gift tax on the amount that the value of the car would be. However, there is a federal gift tax on values of $14,001 or more.

This means I have no idea how sales tax works when purchasing a used vehicle from a private seller. Would it perhaps be more reasonable in terms of the amount of taxes I will have to pay for me to \"Purchase\" the vehicle from my father for the low low price of $10? Would this avoid the gift tax?

{"prompt":"Okay so I didn't really get both my front teeth but I couldn't pass up the title and as most TIFU post begin, mine too starts with a little backstory. I'll try to be quick.\n\nSo in the 6th grade I was on my way to school on my bike just as I would do any other day. Suddenly, and I shit you not, some jackass I had never met decided to kick me off of my bike. I wasn't expecting this and so when he kicked the peg of my bike I swerved too hard and as my front tire went perpendicular I flew off the bike, and onto the pavement, teeth first. Luckily my teeth only had some cracks in them and they really weren't noticeable. My lip on the other hand was split wide open but that part isn't important to the post.\n\nSo here I am about a week ago at my friends house having a few beers and taking shots while playing a Mario kart drinking game when some more people show up so we're gonna go to Gamestop to get more controllers. (Sober driver drove, obviously) While walking out of his room my friend looks up and blows on the plastic piece of those pull strings that you use to let down the foldable attic stairs, you know what I mean. (I added a photo of the one in my house but it doesn't have the plastic piece) In any case it shoots up the string and makes it quite high and so I, in my infinite tipsy wisdom decided to beat his \"record\". Now I'm shorter than my friend by a few inches and I know there's no way I'll beat his \"record\" if my breath dissipates before it reaches the plastic handle thing. Naturally this prompts me to jump a bit off the ground so as to compensate for the height difference. I hop, I push with my breath, I only get the plastic piece a few inches up the string. This is followed by me closing my mouth on the way down from the hop and the plastic piece hooking on the back of my tooth and shattering it. The next day I went to the dentist and had my tooth bonded. My mother said it was a Christmas gift.","chosen":"On my bike, shit got kicked\/dragged, fell and got my teeth shattered in the process.

In September she had our baby so that is when I would occasionally hear it while feeding the baby in the middle of the night. I had just assumed whoever this was, was going to work, but the other night my wife was feeding the baby and saw the guy stop at our driveway, pull in and then turn around and leave. Obviously it was the same car because of the muffler. So last night my wife wakes up at 3 and goes into the living room to see if she can see if they do it again. Just as she was about to say screw it and come back to bed she hears the the car, and sure as shit it pulls in our driveway, and leaves. At this point my wife wakes me up quite frantic.

{"prompt":"Long time lurker, made an account to tell this and hopefully stop stressing so much. So I'm a junior in High school, and a clumsy one at that. Yesterday during marching drill before actual practice began, me and some friends were all sitting outside in the small parking lot we have for band and sports personnel. The lot had been empty up until a few minutes before \"the event\" happened. I never noticed a car had come in, and was talking with a friend. Keeping eye contact and walking backwards at a moderate pace as she followed. Last second she yells \"PintoBean, STOP!\" and I quickly stop, stumble over my foot and fall straight back... into a car. I somehow made a 2 1\/2ft wide 1ft tall 1\/2in thick dent in the back door of this car (I'm about 5' 10\" and 145lbs). I limp my way inside to get the owner of the car, and he seems fine with it and just wants me to cover insurance\/ damages if needed, perfect, no issues, just a small mishap. This was reported to the office as an incident and I'm called in the next morning (day I'm posting) and he's in there, they contact my parents, clear things up, and I give the car owner my parents info to talk about insurance and what to do, the school at this point was just a medium for us to work this out through. So later that day I'm called into the office for the school police officer along with the friend I was talking to. We walk in with the principle I talked with in the morning. We are seated, the officer explains everything, tells us to be calm and we can work this out, average stuff. About near the end of him clearing things up, he breaks part of the news (couldn't tell us everything without the presence of a parent\/ guardian) that the owners mom is choosing to go through Juvenile Services and charge me as a criminal instead of just working out insurance. I await tomorrow in which everything will be worked out and my future behold.

{"prompt":"Hello everyone\n\nI ( 18M ) have become to realize that I am an extremely manipulative, controlling, and jealous boyfriend to my girlfriend ( 17 F ). Things were going great until just recently, about 2 months ago, when for some reason I would just get extremely angry, jealous, irritated for little to no reason.\n\nFor example, we're both track and field runners ( we go to the same high school ). This is her first year of track and she decided to join the distance running team based off my recommendations ( I'm a distance runner, and she really enjoyed her first year of cross country ) But now she has decided to try pole vault, and for some reason, this is making me unreasonably mad and extremely jealous of the fact that that means she'll be spending time with 3 other males training, although she has 2 other girls with her. I have no idea what is wrong with me..\n\nI realize that I am being irrational and I beat myself up mentally for it, and tell myself I won't do it again, but then it just happens again, and the same cycle begins. \n\nI am leaving for college and will be ~2 hours away from home in a few months while she finishes her last year of high school ( She's a junior, I'm a senior ).

{"prompt":"So I broke up with my SO about 4 months ago - it was the cleanest possible breakup, due entirely to conflicting schedules and lack of time, so there was really no impetus for me to move on. We tried to be friends afterward and did our best, but communication quickly tapered off. I assumed from the lack of emotions I was feeling toward her and the lack of communication that I was getting over her.\n\nThen this week she visited my city.\n\nShe invited a bunch of our old friends (and myself) out for dinner, so I figured, sure, why not, let's cement her status as a friend. This will be casual enough.\n\nAnd it was. We had a great time, laughed like crazy, and found ourselves finishing each other's sentences like we did when we first fell for each other. It was a really fun night, closed with a loving goodbye hug.\n\nI say loving because the second I go, reality smacked me in the face. I was still in love with her, just as much as when I broke up with her. I spent the night brooding over it, and decided that the best course of action was to be blunt about it. I texted her the next day telling her in fairly simple terms what the night had done for me - it made me realize I was still head over heels for her.\n\nAnd she never responded.\n\nI'm entirely okay with that. Hell, I'm happy about that. It put things into perspective. Four months of acting like I was okay with being friends with a girl I never even had the chance to see that way wore on me.

I'm awesome, and I don't need her to tell me that to know it. I feel like I've lifted a weight from my shoulders, and for the first time in four months I'm genuinely happy to be single.

{"prompt":"Hi, quick backstory is my now ex-boyfriend decided that he wasn't happy and instead of hashing it out with me and seeing what could be done he came straight to Reddit where people confirmed that it wasn't working and that he should end it. I think it's a shame that no one encouraged him to discuss with me. All he did was give me a \"trial week\" that I had no idea about and during that week he didn't discuss anything, issues or fixes. I was kept in the dark and then suddenly, he just ends it and stops talking to me. (The no contact rule should only really be used to get over someone who you don't want to be friends with again in my opinion. It's more damaging than people realise..)\n\nSince this has happened I have been able to self-reflect and have learnt what I did wrong on my own and am on the path to becoming a better, more optimistic person. (I had some depressing issues in my life making me miserable) But I realise that there is not much of a chance now to work things out since he is absolutely set on his decision.\n\nIt really pains me that he wasn't able to confront me and try to work things out. Don't cut a knot when it can be untied. I have lost an amazing guy and I know that fighting for him just pushes him away further.

{"prompt":"I've been seeing this guy I met at a local bar for around 2.5 months now. Things have been good-we have not put a label on anything, but we've been seeing each other once or twice a week (he travels for work and I just started a new job, so we're both pretty busy) and have had a great time. He has-based on general enthusiasm while being around me and physical affection-given me the impression that he is into me and I am happy to take it slow as far as labels and such go. This weekend,  he cancelled a date we had planned and after I said I wasn't free later that weekend because I had a work meeting to prepare for, he stopped texting me back. We do usually talk a bit via text every day and he often initiates these conversations, but it's been radio silence for 3 days now, after he didn't text me back over the weekend.\n\nLast year, I got out of a 4 year relationship, so I am pretty new to the dating game and feeling a bit confused.

{"prompt":"Just thought I'd throw this out there and see what opinions arise out of it:\n\nOver the past decade our internet usage has been moving rapidly towards a model that utilizes mobility.  With the release of the iPad and the mainstream adoption of Android devices combined with the construction of nation wide 4G networks an ever increasing dependency on wireless data services is emerging.  My fear is that telcoms will separate this form of data transfer from hardline services such as cable or DSL and will clam that they aren't subject to the same rules concerning Net Neutrality.  I know this is bullshit, you know this is bullshit, but little Suzie must have her new iPhone and what does it matter if the telcom charges her just a little more for the internet service because \"that phone requires more bandwidth\"... it seems, they already do this as the N1 service through TMobile featuring \"Android Web Service\" is $20\/month more expensive than the same plan featuring identical, unlimited web service.

{"prompt":"So this one is kind of tame in comparison to some of the problems on here but here goes anyway. My friend is getting married and has asked me to be the best man but he said, quite assertively, that he wants me to be clean shaven for the ceremony. At the time I was caught off guard and happy to be asked so I said okay. However having had time to think about it I feel like it's quite unfair for him to ask that. It took me months to grow this beard and I'm very fond of it. A lot of people have told me I suit it and it does actually mean something. My last girlfriend couldn't bear the feeling of my stubble so I had to have a wet shave every day which I hate doing. That relationship ended really badly and growing the beard was (is) part of me trying to move on. My friend doesn't know this and has mainly seen the beard in context of me being a mess as I stopped looking after my appearance when I sank into quite a deep depression. I'm clawing my way out of that now and I've started to make an effort again. The beard is still there but a lot neater and last night was the first time my friend has seen it like this (he works away for stretches at a time and asked me to be his best man on the phone). He appeared to be looking at my beard thoughtfully last night, perhaps realising it is a style and not just a mess. I didn't bring it up last night because I was unsure if I'm being selfish. Am I?

I will be attending a psych this afternoon but wanted to ask a few stuff here before if I should mention my problems.\n\nI started a birth control for the first time, Yaz\/Yasmin, a pill, late September because my LDR boyfriend would be visiting me on October. A few days after bcp, I turned into a psychopath, severely depressed and severely annoying monster. I would always pick up fights.

{"prompt":"Sorry for wall of text.\n\nThis is an issue that has been ongoing for most of my life. My father, while incredibly successful and a great provider, has always been emotionally abusive to my mother. Luckily it has never turned physical (AFAIK), but whenever I visit home, I hear my father scream at and berate my mother for every little thing. For example, my father is an incredibly reckless driver. Whenever my mother comments on something he did that was unsafe, it turns into 2 hours of him screaming at her for constantly criticizing him. He also screams at me and my siblings about mundane things e.g. not cleaning something properly, dropping something, not using utensils correctly (?? who knows).\n\nI'm at a loss at what to do. I absolutely adore my mother and my father is enjoyable to be around when he is not angry, but I'm tired of seeing her screamed at by him. Whenever I bring up this issue, she always tells me that he is working on his temper and has other good qualities.

In August of 2008, I had just quit grad school, hated my life, and was really exceptionally depressed.  I was renting a tiny bedroom in a house in the middle of nowhere, and I had no job.  [I weighed 245 pounds]  I got a job waiting tables, and my weight slowly began to drop.  Starting in November of 2009, I liked what had been happening and decided to actively try losing weight.  By September 2010, [I was down to about 190] had a great job, great friends, and was really, really stoked.\n\nHere's where things get tricky.  Around this time, I started dating a super-excellent guy.  Our social circles have meshed effortlessly, and we spend a lot of time together.  He's a really picky eater, though, and doesn't like most of the stuff that I do (which is, coincidentally, the food that's helped me lose weight), so we end up eating out a lot.  Not only has my wallet taken a solid hit, I've gained about 15 pounds since we started dating.  Not enough to really *see*, but I'm definitely more sluggish, and it bothers me a lot.  On top of all this, I've become much more busy, now that I have a \"real\" job and I have an active group of friends.\n\nWhat do I do, folks?  I really don't know where to go from here.  I honestly don't know what a good goal weight for me is, and while I can work more activity into my life pretty easily, I don't know how to deal with the \"I'm always out, what on earth do I eat?\" problem.\n\nI'm sorry if this was weirdly-phrased and rambly -- I'll clarify if y'all have questions, but I really would love some help on how to get myself together again.","chosen":"Started losing weight and gained 15 pounds since dating awesome guy, not sure where to go from here.

Neither of us are marriage people, but we're basically in that stage of our relationship, to give you an idea. We've lived together for most of our relationship and we've grown very comfortable with each other, which is great. \n\nNow, we're kind of drifting into that territory where the sex has decreased a lot.

This is complicated by the fact that we live in the same neighborhood, went to college together and share some common acquaintances.\n\nEven though breaking up was very hard on me, I also stupidly followed through on a macho impulse to act as though it didn't particularly bother me at the time and, when she asked me how I was so calm, told her that it just felt better now that we had made a decision.\n\nSo, I think this adds up to me having been a jackass. And I really regret it because I have no end of respect for this woman. I've thought on and off about reaching out to apologize because it seems like the right thing to do, but I don't want to weird her out now 6 months out from breaking up.\n\n I have no desire to get back together with her, nor do I think she'd be interested in dating me again.

The two of us are seniors, but she hasn't done anything with her life to transition into being a young adult. She didn't take the SAT's not even for in regards for applying to college, but the community college system in my area, it accepts if you get a certain score you can skip english 101 and even get into the scholar program at the community college. She hasn't even looked at what classes she wants to take or save up any kind of funds to pay for it, since her parents won't. Also, she has no prospect or interest getting a job, she hasn't put her self out there in any respect, I almost got her to apply to where I work, but she didn't actually send in the application because her boyfriend said, \"to not conform.\" Okay, her boyfriend is actually a nice guy, I was friends with him before they started dating, it's just that he's a sophomore with pretty bad ADD, who can't really relate to having to be a senior in high school, getting ready to grow up.

{"prompt":"Let's limit my question to parties where there are a bunch of folks who at least all share the host(ess) in common (as opposed to bars). I have no problem connecting with strangers in this type of situation and love to engage people and talk.\n\nOccasionally, I'll click really well with someone. We'll have had a great conversation, a lot of flirting, and there's clearly some interest. But when it comes time to actually ask the person out\/suggest they come home with me, I freeze up and end in a, \"Welp! Great talking to you!\"\n\nI find this applies both to potential casual hookups and potential dates. Though there is more pressure if it's a potential hookup.\n\nI feel like there is never a good time to ask either question.

Saturday party, met a fantastic woman, but could not bring myself to ask her out (though, she is the sister of a friend, so that added a bit of pressure to it). Then, Sunday BBQ at my own apartment, cute girl shows up, is clearly into the idea of maybe sticking around until morning (the hints were not very subtle, and I was totally into the idea), but I just can't make it happen because she's my roommate's girlfriend's friend, and I feel like they'll get all judgy. Even though they'd probably encourage it in the end.\n\nI met my last girlfriend at a party in this sort of situation, but could not bring myself to ask her out in front of people, and instead found her and messaged her on Facebook (which she was surprisingly ok with).

{"prompt":"This thought came to me while I was watching the film Gravity. Now I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't watched it, but without giving anything important anyway, there is a scene where our protagonist, faced with almost certain doom, calms herself down by listening to random radio broadcasts coming from Earth. She can hear them, but they can't hear her. It's a nice scene because it reminds you that if you were faced with your own impending mortality, you would instantly miss the most mundane parts of life, and one of its most simple pleasures - the luxury of not having to worry about your own death.\n\nThis scene just made me realise - and you can trade out the protagonist's imprisonment in space for anything, such as a cancer diagnosis or life on death row - these people would trade anything just to get back the opportunity to wake up in the morning of a standard day where your biggest worry is getting to work on time, or finishing an essay for college.

The fighting was about the drama things would bring if things didn't work out between Allison and I.\n\nFast forward a couple months Allison and I start talking again and ended up making out a couple of times.

{"prompt":"Hey guys, so TIFU in front of all my classmates and didn't realize it until after my teacher pointed it out.\n\nI'm currently taking an intro to psychology class over the summer at my university. Today in class we talked about Motivation and Emotion, covering a chapter per day as usual. One of the topics is the Drive Reduction Theory of Motivation, where physiological needs cause internal drives and the organism acts to satisfy the need, and tension is reduced. We tied it to sex because college kids, and the issues of meeting online people for sex came up (Tinder, Craigslist, Grindr) and then someone compared that scenario to an Uber taxi, since the driver of the Uber is a stranger. I talked about how one Uber driver locked the back doors of his vehicle and started masturbating next to the female passenger.\n\nExcept I made the hand motion while I told the class that the guy was masturbating. \n\nSo my professor busts out laughing, my friends bust out laughing (our class is like 10 people so we're all friends here) and the guys at the end of the table who couldn't see my hand motion asked me to do it again. They probably thought I'd actually SEEN the video and not just heard about it.

{"prompt":"So I recently broke up with my girlfriend of two months. We are currently in a semi-long distance relationship (1 hour away) because she goes to school in LA (her hometown is 6 hours away from me). I drive to visit once a week and my mom was starting to get a little angry because she says it's a waste of gas and I should only visit her once every 2 weeks.\n\nIn addition, my parents had two conditions for me to stay with her (1. She converts to Catholicism and 2. She agrees to move to southern California if we get married). Now my mother told me that I had to ask this right away before things get hard on me later. \n\nI personally don't care if she converts or not because I respect her own beliefs and I know that she respects mine. However, I really love my family and it made my mom sad at the thought of me possibly moving far away from her in the future and that she is of a different religion. I know that she is scared that I will get hurt because a long distance relationship is pretty risky but I really love this girl. My gf is really easy to talk to and really makes me happy. I have never met someone that clicks with me like her and I know that she feels the same way. The thought of us ending without closure makes me sad and I do not want to give up. \n\nMy gf said that she does not want to convert and that she does not want to be tied down on where to live in the future. She believes in just seeing where life takes her. \n\nI know my mom will get over the religion thing but I do not know how she will handle me possibly leaving my hometown in the future.

{"prompt":"Going to make this as short as possible.  Basically a long time friend of mine said something that really bothers me. I want to get Reddit's opinion.\n\nBackground details: Growing up my family was flat broke because my mom was in school to become a lawyer and my dad was sick and couldn't work. Years have past since then and my parents are in a much better financial position.  They pay for my car and insurance, and cell phone.  I pay for the rest of my expenses like rent, internet, gas, groceries, utilities, entertainment, booze, etc. Sometimes I fall short and my Mom will take me to the grocery store but that's pretty much the extent of my acceptance of money from my parents. \n\nSo anyway's, me and a few friends were discussing a trip we were going to take.  I had a shift at work the day we wanted to go and I said I could get it covered. More people wanted to go than there were seats in the car and my friend starts saying \"don't you want the money from that shift, I thought you said you were broke\" and I just said \"well, w.e\" because I wanted to go on this trip. He then says mocking me \"I'll just ask my Mom for that $100\".\n\nClearly I'm kind of upset about this because I don't like accepting money from my parents when they've worked so hard to earn it.  I'm trying hard to reach financial independence and I don't advertise or show off the fact that they pay for certain things. But at the same time, most people in their early 20's are still a financial burden to their parents in some way shape or form. I mean this guy lives at home with his mom and doesn't pay for anything except his own internet service because his mom doesn't need or want it. \n\nSo what's your opinion Reddit? Am I a piece of shit for accepting money from my parents. Do I have a right to be upset with my friend for chirping me over it when I've always been respectful to him?

{"prompt":"So my ex gf and I dated for about 6 months. We hit things off really well and found we have incredibly similar tastes, hobbies, interests, etc, but failed to be compatible personality-wise. It was my first relationship so I had a good deal to learn and I wasn't exactly the fastest learner.\n\nAnyways, we jumped into the relationship very quickly, after maybe a month of talking, and had sex very soon. The beginning was nothing like I had anticipated and we had a ton of road bumps along the way but were always able to patch things up. Things eventually got much better after a big fight and we were together all the time and loved each other's company. Towards the end of the relationship I felt her pulling away. I consider myself the jealous type and I think that's for a couple of reasons: I have always been put down for my looks and developed a generally lower self-esteem, and also because she was insanely hot. From the moment she caught my eye till today, she has always been the most beautiful girl I have seen, and I always made sure she knew that. So my jealousy of whenever she'd talk to other guys was definitely something that was always present.\n\nBasically now it's all over and we're not even near each other distance-wise.

Yes cosmetic surgery may be an option, but people will say 'its not needed' and it's questionable how much it can achieve (i.e. can't polish a turd).\n\nI have grown up and lived a life with a fairly ugly face and as such I've noticed the way I've been treated in life, through jobs, social situations, romantic encounters and just general attitudes towards me (people pre judge you because of how you look).\n\nIt annoys me that natural beauty prevails in almost all situations, whether it's getting that job, getting a stable relationship, growing social circles, having 'good luck', having people 'help out' \/ 'be nice on first meeting', even getting something like a picture of your cat to the front page (if the OP is beautiful it goes to the front, if not it gets downvoted), youtube channels getting more popular than others, etc.\n\nYou only have to look at a typical 'reddit post your photo' thread to see this in action, with the users upvoting beauty to the top.\n\nI guess it mostly stems from natural selection \/ our animal instincts to mate with the superior candidate (beauty is an indicator of good health), but the poor people who have to live with this have no choice.

{"prompt":"Sometimes I get the feeling that hanging out with this close group of friends is allowing me to miss so many opportunities in life.

I'm constantly out doing stuff, whether it be running and being active or making plans to go do active stuff, i.e. being outside. They never seem excited to do these sorts of things and would rather spend their nights inside, watching Netflix, drinking liquor\/beer, or playing video games. It's really frustrating sometimes. They're a great group of people that I genuinely enjoy spending time with because they're good natured, funny, and we all support eachother when someone is going through a rough time. I just hate that they never want to be active and go to events\/places like I do. It's always a fight for \"time\" and \"money\" and \"getting off work\", etc, etc - the list goes on. But I know that's it mostly bullshit because they are happy to plan an event where we get together at someone's house just to drink and have fun.\n\nI don't know what to do. I understand that I can meet more people who are into a similar lifestyle as mine (thank god my girlfriend is an active person), but I've known these guys for so long, I just wish I could motivate them into losing weight and being active - they have no idea what kind of life they're missing.","chosen":"My friends are very overweight and never want to put any effort into their lives.

I'm overweight and a racial minority in the Southern US; so it's been hard for me to connect to ladies where I live. Been on the road to better myself and I'm getting there; including the self confidence and whatnot.\n\n**Curren Situation:** So a friend of mine borrowed my phone to text some girl (A) that I don't know.

I help facilitate communication and they're starting to work things out!

She thinks another girl (B) might be a good match and I ask her to set me up. She agrees and tells me she'll do what she can.\n\nSo I keep joking back and forth and yesterday (about week after the initial text) I finally go up to meet \"A\". Some beers, some friends and a good time was had by all. I remind her to bring that hot lady friend \"B\" next time.\n\n**SHE COMES THROUGH!**\n\nSo. I know little about \"B\". Me, A, B, and another person are all going to a hockey game this Saturday. I've asked \"A\" about \"B\", and whether or not she thinks \"B\" and myself will click. \"A\" thinks we will.\n\nMy plan is to just have fun at the game; get \"B\"s number and set up something more 1 on 1 if we survive the initial encounter; but is there something else I could be doing to increase my chances?","chosen":"Girl sets me up with her hot model girlfriend; I never did this before.

I've flown over a couple of times, we fell in love, so we're currently 6 months into the relationship and we're long-distance.\n\nThe problem is that he has a weird sense of humor.

Needless to say, most people who heard him make those jokes don't understand that he's joking. I've gotten somewhat used to this, so I can recognize when he's serious and when he isn't most of the time, but sometimes he sounds too convincing. For example yesterday he said something sexist to me. It hurt me, but I thought that he probably didn't have any malicious intent and might have just been ignorant when it comes to this issue, so I gently tried to explain what was wrong with what he said. His reaction upset me greatly, so to avoid making a scene and saying things I'll regret, I said goodnight and logged off. I woke up the next day to messages of him apologizing profusely and clearly being very sad about it. Turns out he thought I was joking too so he played along, while to me it looked like he was mocking me for what I was saying. And this is not the first time it has happened. I tried talking to him before about it, but his only reply to this is \"How can you seriously think I'd say those things? Do you really think I'm such a terrible person?\". But what the heck else am I supposed to think when he sounds like he absolutely means it?! Even when I say that what he said upset me, he thinks I'm joking too.\n\nHe's not a bad person, he's actually very kind and sweet, so I understand why it saddens him when I take him seriously.

{"prompt":"My GF recently became my fiancee.  I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a \"$60k wedding\" and \"the groom\/his family\" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.\n\nWe can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k\/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.\n\nThe problem is that I don't want to just say \"no\" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.

I want to go out with her, she doesn't want to go out with me (or anyone else, because she doesn't like the commitment). I asked about the future, she said 'maybe', but she likes how it is now apparently.\n\nSo, I really like her and want to go out with her, but don't think we should do the whole long distance relationship thing over Summer.  She still isn't completely over her ex from home, so she may end up having sex with him, which doesn't bother me too much, I told her she should do whatever she thinks she needs to, in order to help her decide about us. So my hopes right now are that she comes back next year and wants to go out, but for now we're friends with benefits, but it's pretty clear it's something more to me and she said that nothing would have happened if the person were anyone but myself, so you can take that however you see it. I'm not sure if we should keep going the way we're going or stop now.","chosen":"I like this girl and want to go out with her, but she's not over her ex from home.

{"prompt":"My fiance and I have a relationship of 5 years and we're about to get married. I've been completely faithful to him-- I barely even talk to other men. He's an extremely flirtatious guy with tons of gal pals, always making new ones too. \n\nOn our second or third date, we discussed how we've both been brutally hurt by infidelity in past relationships and agreed to enter a strictly monogamous relationship. He told me he found out his ex girlfriend (whom he dated from 16-25) was cheating on him and it destroyed him. I assured him he would never have to go through that again. \n\nAbout a year into our relationship and living together, he started making jokes about my \"other boyfriend\". If I was late coming home, he would ask if I lost track of time at my other boyfriend's house. If I asked him if he's seen a certain piece of clothing of mine, he'd say \"you probably left it at your other boyfriend's house.\" I'd get annoyed and roll my eyes but we'd both laugh it off. \n\nOver the years it became more often, and I started to get annoyed. Now it's ALL THE TIME. It's in response to almost everything I do or ask. He's been much more concerned about his penis size lately too. He's average but he's always asking me about my past and if my other boyfriend is bigger. It's to the point where I think he actually believes I have a side guy. I've told him to stop and that it hurts me. He says \"Don't be so sensitive, I'm only playing with you. You know I trust you.\" It worries me that the more I tell him to stop, the more he does it. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this or have done it to their S\/O? I've tried serving it back to him but he just gets a huge kick out of it. I can't tell why he's doing this and why he won't stop. I wonder if it has something to do with how his ex traumatized him.","chosen":"Fiance constantly jokes about my other boyfriend, worrying me.

I didn't want to be judgmental, I wanted to think he could be redeemed and that so long as he wasn't directly harming anyone that it'd be okay, but it's not. I feel so much disgust now. \n\nI seem to keep finding guys like this, who tell me how they want to murder people or hurt people and all of this dark, dark stuff.

{"prompt":"I've been friends with this guy that goes to college on the same campus as me for over a year. We would always catch up and hang out between classes, and even have some homework nights that would involve wine and getting our work done. I had always had a crush on him but he is so hard to read that I thought I was completely friend zoned.\n\nIt wasn't until one night I came back from the bars early and wanted to keep drinking that I asked if he was down to hang out and drink. I went over and we drank, talked and ended up watching episode after episode of a TV show. No moves were made this entire time. Then as it reached the early hours of the morning I fell asleep during one of the episodes and he woke me up to basically making out with me and hooking up.\n\nAfter this I didn't know what to do so I just sort of waited for him to say anything and I think we were both in shock so I just got dressed and we swapped a few words and I dipped out. Just recently we hooked up again after he came to a kickback I threw and we went back to his apartment with friends to play some drinking games and then I went back to my place only to get an invite to come back down. After this hookup he's the one that left me and told me was only leaving bc he had to be up in 3 hours. But we never kiss or anything after its just put on clothes and awkwardly showing each other out the door.\n\nHis friends have been pushing me to go after him and saying that he's lazy in the fact that he can want something but never really goes out of his way to get things.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend and I live in a managed apartment community, have lived here for about two years. We moved to this city in huge part because of the lower living expenses. When we moved in, we were told to expect increases of at least $25 on lease renewal, and last year the rent increased $27 which was *totally* reasonable. Currently we pay $936\/month for a 2\/2, which we split about 40\/60.\n\nThe other day I got a renewal offer in my email, the lowest priced option was $1051\/month, which is an increase of $115 a month and seems unreasonable. I called and spoke to one of the girls in the front office and was told she can regenerate the renewal offer in a week and see if the prices change, but the manager was not around so I couldn't get any more info\n\nWhat's the best course of action here? For background, we are doing okay financially(0 debt, we each have at least a 6 month emergency fund, there's money left over to save each month but not a ton), but we are planning to get married soon and the extra $115 a month is money I had mentally put aside for modest rings and a short honeymoon. Add to that, we will have about $2k in additional expenses in November outside of our regular bills... so the idea of our rent going up after that stresses me out.\n\nMy question is this -- is there anything we can do about this? I've looked up the law where I live and they are within their rights to increase the rent however much they want as long as they give us notice. I have drafted a letter detailing our excellent payment history, how we've never had any problems, mentioning the cost\/risk of new tenants, etc., and suggesting that the max increase we will accept is 5%... but I'm not sure that this would have any effect. The girl I spoke to in the office basically said \"the computer does it\" and that she has no say, but I'm thinking the manager might. Does anyone have any experience with this? Are we basically screwed? And also, am I wrong to think this much of an increase is unreasonable?","chosen":"Two year lease on a 2\/2.

He has suffered from depression for a few years now and when I first met him he was suffering from a (one-off according to doctors) psychotic break that consisted of grandiose delusions. He went to a hospital and stayed til he was better (2 weeks). We have a quiet, boring relationship, hardly any sex due to his low sex drive, but thats okay. I still adore him.\n\nI give alot more than he gives in the relationship but I consider it worth it because I love him alot. He was also horrible at communication during our relationships. Not many calls or texts but we never went over a week without speaking.\n\n2 weeks ago, during (and what still is) a very stressful time for me (end of uni, court cases, birthday, moving out of home) he stopped talking to me. After a week I called his parents whom I was in contact with due to his mental illnesses, and was told he flew to Sydney with his father. He sent me 1 text joking he might get me a present. According to his parents, he got back 2 days later. I didnt hear from him again for another week. I figured this was his cowardly way of breaking up with me. \n\nI admit I may have gone a little text crazy but after deciding he has dumped me, I sent one last \"I'm sorry, I wont text or call again\" text. 2 days later he messaged me saying \":'( I'm so sorry. I know I'm horrible, I can't stop crying\", I left it a few hours, and texted back that it didnt really clarify anything for me as to whether we are still together.\n\nHe still hasnt messaged me yet and I'm unsure what to do or what he is meaning.

He broke up with me for someone else in October 2014 after I moved to a different state for work. We reconciled briefly (~3 weeks) back in early January, and it ended because he cheated on me twice with the guy he initially left me for, and they're still together. During our period of reconciliation, I learned that the guy cheated on my ex non-stop for the 2 months they were first together (think anonymous sex ads on craigslist).\n\nSince then I found out that they have moved in together in a bougie apartment in the city that I've been trying to get to for years.

{"prompt":"No throwaway because the Dow was down and I'm feeling like enough of a ballsy idiot. This happened now.

An hour in, which is usually when I feel like I'm about to pass out and shut my laptop off, I realized that I felt more awake, so I made myself some tea and tried for another hour. No dice. I went to pour myself another cup of tea and realized the Lunesta bottle was next to the bed, which made no sense, because I didn't take it in the bathroom.

The lot had been empty up until a few minutes before \"the event\" happened. I never noticed a car had come in, and was talking with a friend.

Everything was going fine and I felt that the honeymoon phase would last forever, but as it always ends up, it slowed down.\n\n I guess that's good because we learned to work on our relationship and we both understood that it's not easy to maintain a relationship.

So, when she got back from vacation a couple days ago I told her about all of this. She agreed and we also went the route of saying we're both 20 and it's hard because we're in college and we both have different urges. We both agreed that we both wonder if there's anything else out there that is better than one of us because this is the first serious relationship either one of us has had. She said she wished we could take a break for 2 weeks and see how it feels (not like going to go fuck anything that moves break but a see how it feels to be single)  and then go back to normal right after. \n\nThis is impractical. We both value the relationship very much but for me it seems to have gone stale, mainly because we usually do the same thing when we're at school because lack of transportation\/laziness. I'm not sure if it's other forces in my life such as not being in good shape, low self confidence in my body, or just the stresses of growing into an adult. I also feel that life is getting stale.

We hand raised this kitten from birth and she is the sweetest, most precious girl ever.\n\nWell, this morning at about 1am, I sat in our recliner. Now, I always check underneath before I sit down because she likes to nap under there.

{"prompt":"Okay, so it's a little complicated. Here's some backstory:\n\nWe dated about two years ago, but things ended with a lot of hurt on both sides. It was a silly thing, a small argument that got out of hand because we were long distance and too young to know how to cope with that. I never really got over him, and a few months ago took the step of contacting him again. Since then, we've been talking and getting along very well. So here's the issue...\n\nI am still very much in love with him, and want nothing more than to be with him. He tells me he feels the same, but is unsure about taking it to the next level. We are still long distance (opposite ends of the UK), and I believe that he is scared that the same thing will happen again. I understand this, it was incredibly hard to handle, but we are different people now, more able to handle small disagreements like that. Yes, long distance is taxing, but if it's worth it...\n\nHe also seems to have very set ideas about what I will 'expect' from him. This is very frustrating for me, as these are his ideas and have no bearing on what I would actually need\/want in a potential relationship. He seems to misread all my well intentioned conversation as me distrusting him, wanting to know where he is and what he's doing 24 7, when in reality I am simply enquiring about his day. I am merely interested in him, naturally so considering my feelings.\n\nIt is a very difficult situation for us both. But I love him dearly, and want nothing more than a chance to show him that. It causes me great pain that he cannot see this, and I am honestly terrified that he will throw this away rather than risk the hurt. I think it could be something beautiful.","chosen":"I am still in love with the guy that broke my heart. I want to be with him, but he refuses to take the next step.

{"prompt":"So I am flying to orlando florida tomorrow for family wedding and originally my family was going to pick me up from the airport to go to the wedding. However there was a bit of a problem\/mix up on their end and now I have to get from Orlando to the wedding site.  I am 28 years old and have rented a car on several occasions and it isn't that big of a deal.  Fast forward to me attempting to book said rental car and I pull it out of its little flap which I never do and I come to find out that my license is not only expired but expire by about 9 months.  I have used that ID for months for alcohol, flights, everything without one word said to me once. Not only that I have been paying car insurance this whole time without a word from the insurance company, thank god I am a decent driver.  Now I have to figure out what the hell I am going to do once I get to florida. It doesn't look like there is anything like a shuttle and it would be prohibitively expensive to get a taxi....

{"prompt":"My girlfriend dumped me 3 months ago.  We had only been together for like 6 months, but she was actually my first serious relationship.  We were best friends, and I became very emotionally invested.  When she ended things, it seemed out of the blue for me.  I still don't really know what happened, she just told me that she felt like we were \"incompatible.\" \n\nAt the advice of every single one of my friends, I did the best I could to ignore her and separate myself from her.  I found that I could only do this for so long (2-3 weeks max) before one of us caved and started talking to the other.  \n\nA few days ago she made a vague comment that I (apparently wrongly) interpreted to mean that she still has feelings for me.  We were talking a lot in the days since, and things felt just like old times.  However, I talked to her and found out that she is definitely not interested, so I feel like I'm back at square one.  \n\nI have no idea why it's so difficult for me to move on. I find myself thinking about pointless things like how much she cares about me, how much she ever cared about me, how happy she is without me, etc.  I feel like I'm just torturing myself but I don't know how to stop.\n\nShe also told me that she finds it hurtful \/ emotionally difficult when I stop talking to her.  I just feel like as long as I still want a relationship with her and she still doesn't, we're just on uneven footing and it's just hurting me more.\n\nI find myself totally unable to just cut her out, and since I keep trying and failing, it's just hurting us both.

I agreed, but was crushing on another girl at the time, and waited until that fell apart a few months later to ask her out.\n\nWe met for dinner on our school's campus just to get to know one another and it went pretty well, so I asked her to go to dinner and a movie with me (I know super-imaginative, right?)  She accepted and that date went ok, but I was pretty nervous and I think she picked up on it and it affected her.  \n\nThe next day, she texted me and said she had just gotten out of a relationship and wanted a break, and that we should just be friends.  I said that was fine, believing full-well that she just meant she didn't want a relationship with **ME**, and that we shouldn't stay in touch.  \n\nBut we have stayed in touch, and now that I've already been rejected, I am much less nervous and we have a lot of fun together.  We've been out in groups and alone, and its been a lot of fun.  \n\nThe problem is, now I'm crushing hard on her, and she seems to like me back.  Its only been a couple months since our first \"date\" and she said no then.  I can't tell if she just likes me as a friend, but I'm pretty sure she likes me as much as I do her.  \n\nSince its only been a few weeks, is it acceptable to ask her how she feels now?  I don't wanna mess this up as a friendship, but I figure if we both like each other then why not?\n\nI know this sounds a lot like a \"friend-zone\" situation, but I've already asked her out, and I think now that I'm less nervous she has gotten to know the real me, and likes me more than she originally did.","chosen":"I asked a girl out, and got rejected because I was nervous after the first date.

{"prompt":"So I'm having issues understanding what my girlfriend means, or if I'm even doing the right thing.

The past guys she's dated have treated her like one night stands: bang and bounce.\n\nAbout a week ago, her period started. No big deal. But after her period stopped, she was still kinda distant. I asked what was going on and she started crying and unloaded everything. She was worried about our future, she's worried I won't be enough for her, all of her past relationships have lasted a month and they all left. She wants to work on it and right now, we're still talking and together, but I'm having doubts. From what I understand from what she told me, these are irrational thoughts that just pop into her head. When I asked what I can do to help, she told me to \"give her space when [she] needs it, to let her talk to [me] needs\/wants to\". I'm concerned that maybe she's not feeling anything between us anymore.

{"prompt":"Ok so to start here's a brief synopsis of my past relationships: \n\nmy first official one was about a year ago she [20\/F] (I was 21 at the time) was shy and lived in the next state over, and didn't have a car but worked with me to find good times to meet and I made an effort to visit her regularly. It was both our first real relationship so things didn't go very far in the physical department. when the fall semester started we were able to meet more frequently and I though things had been going well but suddenly it ended with her saying that she doesn't have romantic feelings for me after some introspection on her part. I reacted badly and too emotionally (crying and asking why, similar bs) mostly due that being my first real breakup. \n\nMy second relationship went better [21\/f], we hung out a bit during summer (we lived closer and met more often and played some online games frequently) and got comfortable being close to one another but when college started back up I barely saw her. I tried every other week to set aside time for us but she consistently replied that she was too busy with work and school, I told her we could meet any time I wasn't in class but she rarely (once in 2 months) worked with me to find a good time. At this point I became rather dejected but kept it to myself and felt like she either didn't really like me and just wasn't telling me or I had done something wrong, but she said I hadn't done anything. So after a few weeks and only texting, with her changing the subject every time I tried to tell her how I was feeling and going out of my way to make time for us even if it was minimal and non romantic I broke up with her by basically saying that if she couldn't put any more effort into the relationship than she already was that we should just be friends. I was mad at her but I kept it to myself.\n\nI feel I should also say that I'm a high functioning autistic (NLD\/NVLD) who has adapted well but still has a lot of trouble interpreting body language and nonverbal cues.","chosen":"I want a healthy relationship but am unsure how to best progress to that point, my previous relationships did not get to the point where we were emotionally or physically comfortable with one another.","rejected":"After a bad breakup I decided to end things with my GF of 1.5 years saying that if she couldn't put any more effort into the relationship than she already was that we should just be friends."}
{"prompt":"Be sure to explain in detail with line breaks.\nThis is my first post ever on reddit, sorry if my grammar\/format is off im a foreigner ;). Okay so about two weeks ago I was feeling kinda horny, and I felt like downloading hot or not and checking out some girls. I had to log in through facebook, and saw a friend of mine so I clicked on his profile and there was a web of mutual friends. So my friend, had a friend, who had a friend, who was a friends with this real cute girl (sorry, its confusing) and for some reason I scrolled down to her profile and saw her kik. I add her on Kik late at night, she adds me when she wakes up before school. We instantly hit it off and text each other during school the whole day and well into the morning (1am). We then talked the rest of the weekend and this whole week. We decided to meet up soon for a movie and some food. A couple hours later she tells me her friend had a mental breakdown, (this was like 3 hours ago), and confessed she almost killed herself last week. I conforted my lady friend who was in hysterics, and she asked if she could bring her friend along to cheer her up. So here we are having our first date together, alongside her depressed friend.

My gf has anxiety but handled it pretty well, but then her ex-bf called her and told her that he and her cousin had sex twice and that he had to come clean to her. After that, her anxiety went through the roof, and even her attitude towards me has changed.

{"prompt":"Just thought I'd throw this out there and see what opinions arise out of it:\n\nOver the past decade our internet usage has been moving rapidly towards a model that utilizes mobility.  With the release of the iPad and the mainstream adoption of Android devices combined with the construction of nation wide 4G networks an ever increasing dependency on wireless data services is emerging.  My fear is that telcoms will separate this form of data transfer from hardline services such as cable or DSL and will clam that they aren't subject to the same rules concerning Net Neutrality.  I know this is bullshit, you know this is bullshit, but little Suzie must have her new iPhone and what does it matter if the telcom charges her just a little more for the internet service because \"that phone requires more bandwidth\"... it seems, they already do this as the N1 service through TMobile featuring \"Android Web Service\" is $20\/month more expensive than the same plan featuring identical, unlimited web service.

{"prompt":"So this past Saturday a good friend of mine got married. At the reception he had an open bar, like all good wedding receptions do. Having left my keys and car at a friends place I figured I would go a little harder than usual knowing I wouldn't have to drive.\n\nThe reception started around 5 and ended about 10, so during that time I had become pretty drunk. Because the reception ended so early, a few of us decided to head out and hit up some of the bars downtown. \n\nThis is where the fuck up begins, and most of this I've had to piece together through third party accounts and texts\/calls from the night. Heading down there I began to text this girl I had just started seeing and really liked, trying to get her to come meet us. Her and her friends decide to come out, and get there maybe an hour, hour and a half after we did. In that time I had continued to drink and past the black-out point of alcohol consumption. So we meet up, continue drinking, and around 2:00am the bars close and I hitch a ride back to the girls place. All I remember from being at the girls place is being trashed on their couch and at one point just deciding I was gonna leave. I walked out the door thinking I would walk home, about 20 miles away. Luckily I had some sense, and somehow ordered an Uber ride and got home around 4-4:30am.\n\nRoommates weren't home, and my keys were still at my friends place. Amazingly, all luck goes against me and my phone dies shortly after getting there. So I decide to just pass out in front of my apartment and hope my roommates get home early. They don't, and I end up walking to a 7-eleven to get a taxi to go get my keys and car. Finally get into my apartment around noon, charge my phone, and immediately text the girl apologizing for anything stupid I might have done and that I didn't really remember anything. All I get back is \"It's fine\" and haven't heard anything from her since. So now I'm going crazy thinking I ruined a relationship before it even had a chance to start.","chosen":"Was drunk, hit up a girl, ended up having no memory of the night, and now I'm worried that I ruined a relationship before it started.","rejected":"went to an open bar, got drunk and had a blackout, got a ride home and texted a girl I had a thing for to meet me.

I have always had trouble finding guys I would like to date or sleep with too.\n\nOnly problem is I have a boyfriend right now, we've been dating 4 years. I love him a lot but we've had a lot of ups and downs, he treated me poorly in the past, but I had forgiven him. Even though I had forgiven him, it's still never quite the same.

I just don't want to wake up one day and feel I missed out.\n\nI don't really know if I want to dump him or if I should.

Then he came out and told me they had sex everyday and he was high most of the time living with her, trying \"everything but meth\".\n\nI have gotten over it in some way by saying \"it was the drugs, it's not entirely his fault\". I am addicted to smoking and trying to quit, so I started vaping. I told him I didn't want him to do it too because it bothered me because I was worried he would do it as an escapist thing and it made me think about that past situation. I caught him doing it by the sound via skype and got really upset with him. He tells me I need to get over it, but gets jealous when I vape because a male friend gave me a unit (when I use his I hear the sound and get upset because I remember it).

{"prompt":"So as the title suggests, I met this girl at a Physiotherapy clinic I go to for my back. I go there around 3 times a week.

I talk to her a LOT on fb and at the clinic, and we've chilled like once outside the clinic. We open up to eachother and start telling each other a lot of personal stuff. I would have asked her out sooner, but for health reasons, I wasnt able to go out too often. My health has gotten better though. \n\nBut lately, I've noticed that she is becoming a little bit distant, and doesnt talk as much as we used to.

Hell, I asked her to chill today, and no dice.\n\nNow people are saying that I should stop talking to her for a week or so. Just to show that Im not dependant on her.

We've been together for 9 months and I would get upset at the smallest and most insignificant things and completely blow up within seconds. \n\nI started seeing a therapist this past March and I've felt it has helped a little bit. These past few weeks have gotten especially bad though as I have begun resorting to self destructive ways (hitting myself, cutting). My bf can no longer put up with my behavior and is telling me we should end things. I can't help but feel at a total loss now that the person I love most is thinking of abandoning me. \n\nI'm curious to know what other people in similar situations have done\/are doing? For me, it just seems like a vicious cycle that I can't get out of. The same thing over and over again: Get annoyed, get mad, blow up\/yell, calm down, feel regret\/apologize profusely. Basically the same process my father would get into when he would hit me. He once told me to try and talk to him while he was mad and say something like \"Dad, it's ok. you're calm. you don't need to do this.\" But it never worked. \n\nI'm afraid I will just end up like him, hurting everybody around me whether it be emotional or physical.

{"prompt":"My closest friend has been married for a year and a half now to a woman who completely walks all over him and doesn't bring a single good thing to the table.  She has gotten worse and worse over the last year, and currently makes him do all the household work (cleaning, cooking, fixing things, snow removal, dishes, laundry, etc).  I just found out last night that she is now quitting her job with no prospects for a new one.  He works full time, somewhat manual labor, in a high stress position.  The job she left was at a bookstore, and she quit because it was too hard and she \"didn't like it\".  She also has a new (gas guzzling) car that they make payments on, while he drives an old beater because they cannot afford anything more.  She is constantly telling him he can't buy things like a certain grocery item he wants because it's \"too expensive\", while she goes and buys designer clothing at the mall often.  The worst part is that she is a massive \"feminist\" (read: hypocrite) and feels as if she is entitled to an easy life and should be taken care of.  She also treats him like shit on a daily basis and is not afraid to order him around and berate him, even right in front of me.  The final straws for me have been his recent need to start taking anti-depression meds, and her deciding to quit her job.  He is absolutely blind to how bad the situation is (or possibly in denial), and anytime I mention something about it, he gets very defensive and sticks up for everything she does. We spend a ton of time together and have been friends for 15 years, but I'm afraid he will completely close off to me if I sit him down and tell him everything I see and explain how badly he is being treated.  I really do not want to lose his friendship, as it means the world to me, but I feel so horrible letting her treat him like this without trying to change the situation.

He told me he wasn't ready for a relationship and didn't love me anymore so he broke up with me in Dec 2014. I was pretty crushed.\n\nAfter the break up the friend (who was friends with me first btw) and her bff stopped talking to me and hung out with him a lot.

{"prompt":"Okay, so when I was younger I used to stay up literally all night reading. My step dad would come in and check on me when he noticed the light still on, and I'd ask him if I could read for just ten more minutes, thinking he was going to yell at me for being up so late. He never did, because he thought it was the greatest thing ever. It would take me MAYBE a week to read a book. That lasted from as far back as I can remember until a few years ago. For some reason, every time I try to sit down and seriously read or even watch a movie, I can't do it. I read the same thing over and over, or I space out and five minutes later have no idea what's going on in the storyline. I also tend to just fall asleep. I can't even pick a movie to watch on netflix, because I know I won't be able to pay attention like I want to or that I'll fall asleep within ten minutes. This isn't necessarily affecting my every day life except for that I don't read as much or watch as many movies as I used to.

I don't know that name, but I didn't really think anything of it, as my boyfriend works freelance and talks to a lot of people, most of whose names I don't know.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I found myself occasionally wondering who Diane was.

{"prompt":"Hello folks,\n\nI relocated to Boston and have been searching for a place to live in Greater Boston for the last few weeks. Last night, I found a place through a friend. It is an old colonial house in a very upscale neighborhood.\n\nThe house is owned by an 80 year old woman whose husband just passed away. She is spending most of the pension going to Rabbinical school and is renting out two bedrooms on the second floor of the house. Not overtly religious, former English teacher and a very very nice person with good neighbors.\n\nShe is offering me one of the bedrooms upstairs (they are both pretty big) and full access to every amenity in the house for a competitive rate.\n\nMy question mostly comes down to:\n\n1. Should I, as a single 29 year old male live in a house that is owned by an 80 year old woman? \n\n2. Living with someone and having a nice friendly conversation are two completely different things. This lady hasn't lived with roommates in her life and I am not sure if she would be up to it. Also, I don't want to end up being bossed around by the \"owner\" regarding rules, guests, etc. She says that she has no problems with any of those things, but I am not sure she understands that there might be some adjustment required on her end too.\n\n3. Finally, if something were to happen to her (she's pretty old), what would be my responsibility as a tenant? Would I be expected to take care of her to some extent? That is a dealbreaker, I can't do that for various reasons.\n\nAny advice is appreciated. If someone has lived with an older adult with a huge age gap, personal experiences would be invaluable here!","chosen":"I found a house to live in with an 80 year old woman.

We've been dating for two years and have been living together for about 6 months.\n\nAbout three months ago, I met another girl, also a foreign student. I was instantly physically attracted to her, but didn't think much of it, things like this happen all the time. However, after getting to know her better over a period of two weeks I fell in love hard. I could tell she had similar feelings for me, but I kept her at a distance because I didn't want to betray my girlfriend's trust. I have considered leaving my girlfriend to pursue a relationship with the other girl but have decided against it. I love my girlfriend very much, she has inspired me to make a lot of positive changes in my life over the time we've been together and I am happy and proud to be with her.

The other girl is the kind of girl I used to go for in the past and a relationship with her would most likely only end in heartbreak.\n\nOn a night out with some of my friends I ran into the ''other girl'' and a group of her friends. Long story short, I came very close to spending the night with her but instead ended up destroying any chance of us being together, like I had decided before. I'm still not entirely sure whether I did it because I wanted to or because I felt like I had to.\n\nAbout a full month has passed since then, but I can't get the other girl out of my mind.

{"prompt":"I've been using MFP for about a year (pretty steadily, current streak is 45 days) and set my calories at 1200. This is what MFP calculated for me for my height and to lose 2 lbs per week.  I'm typically eating around 1350 calories anyway, but at least shooting to stay under the 1200 most days. I've lost 21 lbs over the past year, which is much less than I should have lost but I've fallen off the wagon a few times. I've been doing it consistently since January 4, and I seem to have hit a plateau. I've lost 4.4 since then, which is a loss of about a pound a week on average, but I saw almost 3 lbs of that in the first week of January and haven't lost in the last 3 weeks but haven't gained either. I also have been on a generally low carb and low sugar diet- no sweets, bread, pasta or alcohol during the week, but sometimes on the weekend. I recently spoke to someone who does keto and they gave me a lot of info which seemed to make sense. They were adamant that I'm cutting my calories way too low and that my body is probably hanging on to fat whenever I am eating over 1200. Basically that my body is in starvation mode, which I previously thought was junk science. She said that calories in\/calories out isn't complex enough and what you eat matters more than how many calories it is. She calculates my TDEE and says I should eat at least 1500 calories. This person has lost over 50 lbs and does talks at various venues so I feel like she should know what she's talking about. Later, I was listening to the doctor radio on satellite and an expert there said that Keto is unsafe and that people on Keto are consuming way too much fat (and typically, red meat) than is healthy and even if they see weight loss, they're likely doing harm to other things like their cholesterol level etc.","chosen":"1200 calories is very low, and I'm losing weight, but not losing in the right way.

{"prompt":"[This] thread got me thinking about the \"disgusting\" things I'd eat if I was *really* hungry. I don't mean the kind of hungry when lunch is still two hours away and the coffee you had for breakfast isn't helping anymore and you groan to your coworker *\"I'm starving!\"* I mean hungry like you haven't had a bite to eat in days and you're not sure when you'll eat again.\n\nFor me, it was 1994 and I was 20 years old living with my first boyfriend. We often survived on end-of-day leftovers at our crappy fast food jobs.

It was almost Thanksgiving and his hours got cut back from 24 a week to 18, then 12, then they let him go altogether. Just before he left, he stole a bag of powdered mashed potatoes. (Desperate times, desperate measures?) We ate mashed potatoes for every meal for a week until it was just gone. Then there was nothing, and it was the day after Thanksgiving and all the food pantries were closed, and then it was the weekend and we were SO hungry.\n\nThose three days with nothing but water were probably the longest of my life. Strangely, after the 24 hour mark I stopped feeling hunger pains and just felt tired and moody. Any time I thought about food, I'd drink water or eat ice. (I found out several years later that while I had been starving, my boyfriend had been secretly visiting his family and having lunch or dinner with them. His family hated me, they felt I stole away their little boy, and there's no way they'd have fed me. My family wasn't talking to me because I was \"living in sin\" with him, so I didn't have backup like he did.)","chosen":"I once went 3 1\/2 days with no food. Physically, it wasn't torture.

{"prompt":"Long time lurker, made an account to tell this and hopefully stop stressing so much. So I'm a junior in High school, and a clumsy one at that. Yesterday during marching drill before actual practice began, me and some friends were all sitting outside in the small parking lot we have for band and sports personnel. The lot had been empty up until a few minutes before \"the event\" happened. I never noticed a car had come in, and was talking with a friend. Keeping eye contact and walking backwards at a moderate pace as she followed. Last second she yells \"PintoBean, STOP!\" and I quickly stop, stumble over my foot and fall straight back... into a car.

I limp my way inside to get the owner of the car, and he seems fine with it and just wants me to cover insurance\/ damages if needed, perfect, no issues, just a small mishap. This was reported to the office as an incident and I'm called in the next morning (day I'm posting) and he's in there, they contact my parents, clear things up, and I give the car owner my parents info to talk about insurance and what to do, the school at this point was just a medium for us to work this out through. So later that day I'm called into the office for the school police officer along with the friend I was talking to. We walk in with the principle I talked with in the morning. We are seated, the officer explains everything, tells us to be calm and we can work this out, average stuff. About near the end of him clearing things up, he breaks part of the news (couldn't tell us everything without the presence of a parent\/ guardian) that the owners mom is choosing to go through Juvenile Services and charge me as a criminal instead of just working out insurance.

{"prompt":"So to make a long story short I made a myriad of financial mistakes when I was younger and instead of fixing my problems I hid from them and wallowed in depression. Over the course of the past 3 years I have fixed almost all of these mistakes and taken care of my depression through therapy and am trying to get on track to have a healthy and successful financial future. \n\nSo about a month ago I get an alert from Credit Karma of a new debt reporting on my credit and my score (which isn't great to begin with) takes a huge hit. I immediately go about checking my credit report. I see a new account labeled as being in collections for about 6k. I freak out for a little and then calm down and begin to investigate. \n\nSo it's seems that this account is collections for a private loan I took out when I was in college. Now, I did not realize I had taken out a private loan, all my other loans were through the federal government, but I was drunk a lot at that time in life as a depressed 22 year old and it's fully possible I went with a private lender to cover some of my school expenses. I look further at this account. It was already on my credit report as a delinquent account from Education Finance Partners. I looked them up and all I could find was that they apparently filed Chapter 7 at some point in the 2000s. This new collection account seems to be that same loan. However, the old loan was reported delinquent in 2008. It's been over 7 years. How can this new company report me as delinquent as of 2015?

She has told me a lot of stuff that she hasn't told too many other people.\n\nShe said at first that she was not looking for a relationship, but recently she said she is looking for a guy who can show her that he deserves her, because shes tired of being treated like crap.\n\nToday, for example, she wanted me to share a chair with her while we worked on our project together.

I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nSo I get home from work and get down to business.  Ozzy's catching on pretty quickly.  Within 10 minutes, I have him rolling onto his back on command.  I was pointing my finger at him and saying, \"BANG!\" as a cue.  Suddenly though, as he's lying on his back, he pees a little.

He's obviously ashamed of himself, even though I didn't get mad at him as it was my fault.\n\nAfter we've cleaned up and gone out for a pee break, I attempt the trick again.

Since then, he gets stressed when you make a finger gun at him, or if you say the word bang.  He will often try to slink under the computer desk or go into his kennel.\n\nSo my theories on what might be going on:\n\n* He somehow associated the memory of wetting himself to the cues I gave him\n* He's afraid of fireworks and thunderstorms and the loud \"BANG\" is too harsh of a cue word\n* The word \"BANG\" sounds too close to the word \"Bad\" and he thinks that when I point at him and say it, that he's being punished for something.\n\nIn any case, it's been months and I can't even bait him to lie on his back anymore.

{"prompt":"Me - 31, Him - 31. We had been going out for three months. I know him through his father. He wasn't my type but I was up for hanging out. He called me every day, and we'd talk. He was polite and gentlemanly, just not my type. He offered to pay every time we went out. Then it really annoyed me that he would go on these racist rants. I would very patiently hear him out and offer my opinion, but being black, I realized that, either way, whether hearing him out respectfully or telling him to fuck off it validated his opinion. Every date has ended with a hug and expressed interest in hanging out again. Yet he has never kissed me or expressed further interest other than calling me every day. He was also evasive when it came to him meeting my friends\/family and vice versa.\n\nThen I meet another guy (35 y.o.), who is everything I've ever dreamed of and more. He's really smart and accomplished, and he is crazy about me. I don't like to juggle guys, so the first guy I just stopped talking to. It was unclear what we were doing (he gladly pays for dinner yet doesn't make a move) and he seems socially inept. It's been a while since I last talked to guy #1, but he keeps texting, writing and calling. He says he misses talking to and hanging out with me. I'm not even interested in being his friend.\n\nToday I blocked him on FB. But I want to give him a verbal message that it's over. What do I say?","chosen":"Guy I was dating was racist and boring.

He's grown into the father figure I haven't had since I moved out 5 years ago. The only problem is he has his own wife and kids. Taking on a 20 year old \"daughter\" probably isn't going to work for him.\n\nOnce a month we meet up for dinner and go over how things have been going. This month we talked a lot about my self confidence and how willing one should be to do things for others (two years ago I was raped and it's bee fucking up my self confidence ever since). I noticed how happy he was to succeed and how much it hurt him to witness my self destructive behavior. We were talking about a recent success when I told him that the only reason I've been working my ass off lately is for his approval. I also alluded to the fact that there are very few people I trust anymore, and he's probably the only person in the world I'd do anything for.\n\nIt's the truth, but I feel like I'm fucking our mentor\/mentee relationship by telling him that. Part of the reason I need his approval so badly\/would do anything for him is because I was in love with him, however incorrectly directed, for over a year which is something that should be left out of our relationship at this point.

Several messages at odd times of the Night of her asking if I will get angry if she hugged her Ex. (Future note: receiving this message should have clued me in, but I was so infatuated at the time I didn't really put too much weight on it.\n\nII.)Frequent Movie visits to movies I had invited her to watch with her \"Brother\", and several visits with her \"girlfriends\" towards the end of the relationship. Which she flat out denied me from even visiting after (for lunch, FroYo and the like)\n\nIII.) Limiting eye contact and constant denial and (soft) refusal to spend time. Tons of excuses such as \"needing to take care of the nephews\", and having a family movie night... EVERY SINGLE TIME I planned something for us to do. To the point that she can't even reserve a weekend for us 4 weeks in advance(Vegas Trip).\n\nIV.)Finding from one of her friends that she was infatuated with her Ex-BF for a year after the breakup, which ended around the same time I start dating her.\n\nI used to feel like I was in the wrong. As if the whole blowout were due to my faults... as if I said something or did something so incredibly bad as to change someone's opinion of me overnight.... but today's revelations taught me that no matter how smart a girl is... she doesn't necessarily know what the hell she wants half the time.","chosen":"Found out that my past relationship was a complete mess due to conflicting signals and excuses from a girl.

{"prompt":"We had a very intense relationship that lasted about a year, although we only spent physically about 5 months together (long distance relationship, him in USA, me in UK). We mutually ended things because of distance and age difference, but I was utterly madly in love with him. Although I've given him plenty of space and allowed him to peacefully get on with his life (he's now in a new relationship and moved state and job, successfully forgetting about me) I've found myself completely unable to move on. Every guy I meet on a romantic level just doesn't compare and I don't feel passion for anything since our breakup, not even for my job or my travels or things that used to get me excited. I feel like I've lost a piece of myself and don't have a purpose anymore unless he's in it.\n\nHonestly we weren't even that compatible, we argued all the time, but there was a chemistry and romance there that I've yet to find again. It's obviously something that's just triggered in my head and turned into this unhealthy obsession that doesn't seem to want to die.\n\nI've spoken to friends about this and they've told me that time is the only cure, but it's been over a year and I'm still caught up on him.

He's not a very social guy and suffers from depression occasionally, so has to take pills to help him.\n\nHe claims to find it stressful to participate in social situations, but he seems to be fine with me.\n\nAnyway, at the very beginning he was more into me than I was into him, but over time I've warmed to him and I really like this guy. However his behavior is very strange sometimes. We see each other every week (apart from this week) and he usually comes round, hangs out, and sometimes we have sex. He seems to really be into me but he claims to not want to make things official.\n\nThe confusing thing is all his actions prove otherwise, he casually dropped into convo that he was my boyfriend. And generally being intimate and affectionate when ever we're together. And the other week he mumbled \"why have you made me love you\" while we were drinking. But now he says I want more than what he does. I just don't get it because up until now, he's been more into me than I have been into him. He says he enjoys being with me, but doesn't want to be my boyfriend. He says he's still into me though, I just don't get it!\n\nCan someone help me decipher this?

{"prompt":"OK, here's the story.  I'm having my second child.  It's going to be a boy.  My first was a boy.  I didn't want to circumcise him, but I gave in to family pressure.  One of the things I was told was, 'don't worry, everyone does it and everyone is fine.'  Well, after seeing the first emotional expression on my newborn baby's face; fear, pain, confusion... it was traumatizing for me to say the least.  Yes, he's fine now, but that memory will always haunt me.  (And perhaps him too, who knows)  \nSo, now, with boy #2 on the way I am absolutely refusing to put myself and my child through that again!  As you can imagine, I feel I am totally alone in this.  Yes, my husband is standing by me, but he is also being affected by the stress of it.  \nNow, I've been raised Jewish, but I'm not a religious person at all.  I've *always* questioned tradition. I don't keep kosher, I travel on the Sabbath, I don't go to temple, even on the high holidays.  So, I can't justify putting another child through, what I feel is, an out dated traditional ceremony.  It just doesn't feel right.  There is an alternative ceremony that includes the blessings and the bagels ;) but no cutting.  \nOf course there's the issue of both boys being different and if it might cause a problem for my child in the future.  \nSo, my question is, are there any Jewish males out there who have gone through this ceremony and what was it like for you growing up?  Are there any brothers out there who are different in that way and how does it effect your relationship?  \nIf anyone wants to share their story about how they wish they were or weren't circumcised, I'd be interested in hearing it.","chosen":"I'm having my second child and I'm not circumcising him.

{"prompt":"Hi there,\nSo yesterday I ended things with a wonderful girl who I'd been dating for a year. For the past couple months little things kept ticking me off, like how she would be afraid to make decisions because she was worried I would be disappointed with her choice.

She is a very sensitive person and so when I would try to talk to her about these things it would usually end in tears and I would struggle to get my point across. I decided to end it when I thought about whether this was someone I could see myself with 5 or 10 years down the road and the answer was no. Of course, there were so many wonderful things that we had together, and I can't stop thinking about what I'm giving up. She loved me entirely for who I am and I couldn't give that back to her.

{"prompt":"So, I never thought it might come to this.\n\nI have narcolepsy. For the longest time, I felt that I had it under control. In school, my condition was misunderstood and I was ridiculed by my peers as well as my teachers. I overcame and found a nice job. I was laid off because of the recession and took up a job with a certain job with a certain game-related company. I tried my best to excel at my job, to the point where I became the Go-To-Guy for information on technical resolutions and policy matters. \n\nToday, I was demoted because my narcolepsy sometimes gets the better of me and I miss work. I cannot afford medical insurance nor the medicine to make it less of an issue ($500 for a month's supply). I was told that the ADA did not apply because attendance was a hard requirement for being a higher level agent. Our HR person told me that any job I get will have a requirement about attendance and that the ADA will never side with me. I am forced to assume an entry level position in a job I used to love. I feel as though my hard work will never pay off now, because my narcolepsy will also stop me from advancing and that ADA does not apply to me. \n\nI still feel like I'm being discriminated against but if what HR told me is true then I do believe that any career I take will be hampered by this condition, which cannot be cured. \n\nPlease, tell me there are options.

{"prompt":"So I've [21 M] recently begun falling for a girl [19 F] from my university and when we're in person we get along fantastically.

But after I got her number it seems that she is pretty bad at the whole texting thing. What I mean by this is just basically if I text her she will either take quite a while to respond to my message or she just won't respond at all (even sometimes if the text has a question in it). And so far after probably a little more than a month being decent friends she has NEVER initiated the texts, it has always been me. Recently at a school bar night we were both drunk and she literally dragged me to the dance floor with her (which is extremely abnormal for me) so I'm thinking this was a sign of interest. But even after that the texting still continues to be the same.\n\nBasically I'm worried because most everyone I've talked to says \"no girl is bad at texting, if she actually likes you she would initiate\/text you back\/respond in a timely matter. Get over her she's not interested\". So I guess my question really is, is it possible for someone to be a bad texter like that but still be genuinely interested in me?

{"prompt":"Hey reddit, obvious throwaway just to be safe. This is an odd situation with me.\n\nEarlier today I was at work having lunch, when Kate decides to tell me and another co-worker a secret of hers. It went something like \"2 years ago, Adam that used to work here engaged in sexual activies\" - she knew I was friends with Adam, she did not know that he lives with me however. \n\nNow, normally I would confront him about it, ask him wtf he is doing, he's my best mate - but he tends to not always think with his head. The problem lies with the fact his girlfriend is also a very good friend of mine, and so if I confront the issue between them, im walking away without a friend. \n\nI know he's better than this, but I am extremely upset. Furthermore, if it was something that happened 2 years ago, I would accept he fucked up and moved on, but Kate decides to tell me that he contacted her this spring. Which means, once a cheater always a cheater. His excuse for it was pathetic, Kate knew she fucked up and declined any more efforts of his.\n\nSo reddit, what should I do? Part of me is inclined to erase this from my memory, it's none of my business, it's between Adam, Kate, and Adam's GF. On the other hand, Adam's gf is crazy about him, wants to marry him, and seeing her waste her life away on this guy is heartbreaking. If I told her, I am scared of what he might to do - he lives with me and it will get ugly, as he has anger issues  (albeit, not as bad as they used to be) and tends to act on impulse rather than with his head.

I've been able to see him in person a couple of times since he left for college (once when I visited his city and asked and once when he came back and said he'd try to see me, which he did.) over Christmas break I tried to see him and he was busy (legitimately so, I believe, but there was no mention of trying another time) and when I messaged him he took much longer than usual to reply so I decided not to try contacting him in case he was trying to get rid of me (I almost always start the conversation.) A little over two weeks later, he messaged me and we talked for about an hour.

{"prompt":"I am a 24\/F, my sister is 26\/F. Here is a small background on our relationship:\nOur entire lives we have fought. When we were younger it was fist fighting and as we got older it became more verbal. My sister is very manipulative, my parent even admit it. They have said, \"We don't know where we went wrong raising your sister.\" Regardless, they love her and deal with her shenanigans; mostly they because they usually aren't directed at them. Things in our relationship came to a head about a year ago and we had what I call a \"come to Jesus meeting.\" We said our issues, spoke our piece and agreed we wanted a relationship with each other and we would try to get to know each other on the adult level and have a clean slate in regards to our relationship.

I want to be able to take off my shirt at the beach, I want to be able to play soccer without flying away and all the other activities.\n\nTired of the skinny guy problems I decided to change by hitting the GYM and eating more. But now that change is finally starting to come to realization, my parents are slowly discouraging me to continue and are advising me to stop. I went from 58.5KG to 64.6KG in a few months, and I'm very proud of my result. But my parents believe that my weight should stay at 64.6KG, and not increase to around 75KG (my goal).\n\nThey believe that my knees and ankles won't be able to hold it out, and when I get old I won't be able to walk properly anymore. Another believe is that ''Lifting is damaging your body because you're an ectomorph'', which frustates me... because there are plenty of other ectomorphs out there and are doing fine, right? Another reasoning they told me is that, even though I work hard now it wont matter because when I turn older I wont have control of my body and I will suddenly get fat or skinny and thus making exercising now useless.\n\nAre my parents right, is excising really damaging my body and will I regret doing it in the future? Or are they still used to seeing the skinny skeleton me, and they don't like change, which is what I tend to believe more but I'm doubting myself.","chosen":"Parents advise me to stop lifting or gain weight because it doesn't fit my body anymore, is excising really damaging my body\/will I regret it in the future?","rejected":"Parents say I'm damaging my body, my body doesn't fit fitness\/working out.

{"prompt":"Background: There is a road in my area where the speed limit drops from 50 to 35 as the road goes from 4 lanes to 2 as it goes through a residential area. This road is kind of a by-pass for a crowded section of Highway 9 (think of Bruce Springstein) in central NJ and also crosses a major east\/west state highway so the local police hang out on that road to get speeders who don't bother to slow down. Locals are aware the police are usually there, somewhere on the road, and keep an eye on the speed limit.\n\nSo, one day, I am driving on that road to pick up my son from his karate class and notice the police car hanging out in a parking lot for a park about a half mile from where the speed limit decreases, hidden from the road (I usually look to see if a car is there or not). About 15 minutes later I am coming back with my son and slow down as the speed limit drops to 35. Of course some BENNY from NY (think of the cast of Jersey Shore) starts tailgating me and flashes his lights to go faster and gets increasingly frustrated as I refused to go faster. And then I remember the police officer and wondered if he was still in the park. Well, one way to find out.\n\nJust before the park, the road widens slightly to allow space for a left turn lane into the park. Just before we get to the park entrance I move my car ever so slightly onto the shoulder making the temptation too great for the BENNY. He seizes this opening to fly by me through the left turn lane. As I pass the park I notice that not only is my friend still there but his lights just popped on. He comes out of the park, I pull over like a driver is supposed to when an emergency vehicle has his lights on and watch him quickly close the distance between him and the BENNY.","chosen":"I tailgated a guy on the NJ Turnpike who flashed his lights to go faster trying to pass me.","rejected":"BENNY tailgates me thinking I am a cop and then drives past him to get away from him."}

Other co-workers have noticed it and joke with us about it...they'll say something like \"give that to your boss\" and he'll say \"pft\". It's getting annoying. What makes it tougher is that we were really cool back when we were at the same level. So that friendship carries over to now and we talk about common interests frequently.

We have a steady relationship and we're very happy.\n\nEarly in the relationship, I went to my friends cousin's house to hang out. My bf didn't come. We were all hanging out and drinking and another of my friend's cousins who I had kissed a few years back showed up. \n\nI got really drunk. The cousin was trying really hard to sleep with me, I kept saying no and he knew I had a boyfriend. \n\nEventually I blacked out. I found out in the morning that the guy kept trying to get me to sleep in his bed with him which I refused (thank god). However someone told me that i was leaning against him on the couch and she wasnt sure but he may have been kissing my neck.\n\nI felt absolutely disgusted after I found this out. I had a huge talk with my friend and she thought it was best for me not to mention it to my boyfriend because it was a new relationship and I had been adamant that I didn't want to hook up with him. I didn't say anything to him.\n\nI hadn't really thought about it much until recently. About six months ago I came to terms with the fact that I have an alcohol abuse problem. I've been sober now for three months.

{"prompt":"Throwaway account, just because.\n\nFor three weeks last month I was traveling for work. An old friend contacted me right before I left, asking if she could stay with me while doing job interviews nearby. I told her that I wouldn't be around but that I would give her free access to my apartment. She ended up staying for two weeks and left the place in great shape. However, I'm just getting around to paying my bills for that period and I realized that my utilities bill is MUCH higher than usual. I've never seen my bill this high before and fall usually has the cheapest months because the climate is so neutral. Unlike most apartment buildings that I know of, each unit is responsible for it's own utilities, meaning that every bill I receive is for my own apartment's usage (instead of a total cost that is split between all of the tenants throughout the building). She was the only one in the apartment for the majority of that period. I thought I was doing the right thing by letting her use my place for free, but now I'm wondering if I should bring this up. \n\nIf I'm ever in a position again where I let someone use my apartment, should I make some sort of stipulation about energy usage?

{"prompt":"I'll try to keep this short and sweet. In the last few weeks of term at college I met this guy. We were basically unstoppable together. Spent every waking hour together, went on adventures, were a big bundle of energy, so alike in every way, amazing amazing sex. \n\nProblem was, he's a pro skier and is gone for 3\/4s of the year training nonstop. We didn't talk about things before we left, but kept talking on the phone, texting for a while. \n\nThen we decided that we had to break things off. It would be almost a year before we would be in the same place again. Skiing is incredibly emotionally consuming. It was fine.

Lately we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hangin with people and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make me feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and frekaing out and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Everytime I mention that I want\/need a night in it feel like he he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends.

{"prompt":"I just recently started dating Penelope, who is two grades behind me. We met at our highschool during choir and musical; and, as youthful relationships typically begin, we are just wild about eachother.\n\nMy question is dual-faceted but I extend it to \/r\/relationships with the idea generally being that I am making an honest attempt to cross the schema gap to be the best boyfriend I can be.\n\nFirst and foremost, the most obvious difference between us is our age disparity of two years. This isn't a huge problem between us, but might be an issue in the future, (parents raising eyebrows, peers being skiddish, etc.) So, what are my ethical obligations to her, (being the older of the two,) how can I traverse the two-year gap so that we have more common ground, and what do I do about negative societal judgement?\n\nThe second factor contributing to my ignorance is that Penelope happens to have pretty bad social anxiety. She arbitrarily experiences episodes where she believes that I'm lying and that the relationship isn't real, and has difficulties talking about the way she feels. She experiences occasional anxiety attacks as well. Her anxiety isn't advanced enough for me to consider it a serious hindrance to our relationship, I knew her for a couple months with that knowledge before making the decision to move forward into a romantic relationship. What can I do to make her feel less embarrassed about her anxiety when it strikes? As somebody who does not experience the same issue, what should I know to be more educated and empathetic going forward?","chosen":"What are my ethical obligations to my girlfriend who is two years younger than me and has anxiety issues?

He asked me out to coffee, and a few days later we ended up at ihop at 11pm and then spent the entire night at the beach in a Gazebo- dancing, singing, snuggling. I have been spending the night at his house 2 or 3 nights a week. It feels like we have been together much longer than we have. We have cried together, laughed, and shared our secrets. \n\nI do not think I know him all of the way, just yet, and I most certainly have not given him the whole life-story. We are already best friends, inseparable. My heart races thinking about him. We have talked about just about everything under the sun. I really do love him.\n\nI am not in love with him, just yet. I do not want to give my emotions up so easily. I do not want to end up falling for someone who I may not end up being compatible with. I felt romantically attracted to one person, before, and it took quite some time to get over that. I am cautious about this guy, and I know he feels romantically attracted to me so I feel a bit guilty that I haven't gotten there yet.

{"prompt":"Story: Met this girl a couple of weeks ago, through a mutual friend.\nShe's very straightforward, friendly. I've been \"jokingly flirty\" since day 1 - the curse of instant crushes - and we've been texting each other almost everyday. In my opinion we're getting along nicely, but she hasn't exposed herself yet - not acknowledging if she realized I'm hitting on her (she *must* have, I'd say).\n\nRecently I've discovered (she mentioned it in passing) that \"her ex's changed\", \"there might be some rekindling\" (almost her words) - after some initial discomfort I decided to play it like nothing's happened, going by a \"what's the worse that could happen\" mindset - keeping on with the \"friendly flirting\" attitude, like dropping \"wow, you're marriage material! [laugh]\" lines, for the sake of giving you an idea. There have been no negative reactions or any shying away so far, so that makes me doubly confused, having almost no experience in flirting and reading signals. Add to this that any physical contact I've initiated (still keeping a 70% friendly, 30% flirty ratio I'd say) was never \"rejected\" or got her to show signs of discomfort.\n\nWe haven't got a one-on-one meetup yet, while we see each other once per week - so far, we've only met for practice and kept in contact through texting - but I've asked her out, to talk about common interests which we have a lot of, and she's eager to.\n\nI might be overthinking or projecting, but being analytical about everything and unexperienced in dating&relationships, this situation confuses the hell out of me. Especially the stuff she mentioned about her ex, it might have been a \"discouragement tactic\" but I'm not sure at all.\n\nI would be...\"fine\"...with dropping a \"wow I didn't really mean that, sorry\" line if she was uninterested, for the sake of friendship, but still being unable to figure out if I *do* have a chance or not is driving me crazy.","chosen":"Got a crush on a girl I've been flirting with, but not sure if I *have* a chance or not.

{"prompt":"Last night I was talking with my girlfriend, things have been rough this month. Everything was going smoothly, nothing out of the ordinary and we began discussing about feminism. I don't actually remember how it came about that but it did. I asked her if she was a feminist and she responded with of course I am. We both live in separate countries (me USA) and my experience with feminism is extremely toxic, she lives in Sweden where its #1 country for feminism (I'm not surprised). She was saying things like how women get paid less, etc. Me trying to not argue with her, doing my best to be logical. She told me don't you want women to have equal rights? I'm like yes of course, but that doesn't make me a feminist. The word itself 'feminism'- isn't equality by itself, that is fighting for women's rights- I'm not going to go into that because that's just- another topic.\n\nSo after discussing about that she kept telling me, you're either a feminist or I'm breaking up with you. My brain 'blue-screening' figured she was just making up an excuse to break up with me but shes being dead serious I believe. Everything else makes sense, her attitude towards me at times or how I just want sex only, it really bothers me and I tell her that.

Over the time from when we started college we've been able to visit each other for a weekend here and there, but never long term. This wouldn't really be that bad, considering when we first started dating we only saw each other for a short time during the week; we mostly communicated through an instant messenger. However, I think that the distance and different circumstances have highlighted a glaring fact- we really don't have all that much in common. When we were in highschool, we could hide this by talking about classes and the like, but now that we don't have any classes, teachers, or experiences in common, our chatting has dried to just about nil.\n\nI am quite the extrovert and can't stand staying inside for a whole day, whereas she is quite introverted and wouldn't mind spending a day in bed doing nothing.

We don't have any 'dramatic' issues, and haven't had any fights in the time we've been together.

{"prompt":"When my girlfriend and I started dating 7 months ago, she mentioned she had a crazy stalker ex who was still crazy over her and would call\/text her once in a while although she said she wouldn't reciprocate. I didn't think much of it.\n\nThis past weekend she told me that this guy tried calling her saying he would try to break up our relationship. When I asked her the reasons why he would want to do that, she was not straightforward with me and I felt something was up.\n\nSo I found the number of the other guy and called him up. Surprisingly, he said years ago she used to be madly in love him and went pscyho trying to ruin his life and trying to break up his relationships. He also said that on the friday before the weekend, she texted him asking to give her and a friend a ride from the bar. Furthermore, he said that they do text each other in a while.\n\nWhen I confronted my girlfriend about all this, she confessed and said everything was true. But she said the only reason she talked to him was to keep tabs as he used to be a big part of her life. As for the reason for asking for a ride, she said she was just drunk with her friend and needed  a ride home (I don't have a car). \n\nShe said she didn't want to tell me about the truth because she didn't want me to get upset. But why did she lie and tell me he's a crazy stalker when in truth she was reciprocating? Also I was shocked she asked him for a ride while she was really drunk. She never told me any of this.\n\nIn all honesty, I don't think she had the intention of cheating, but I just think she doesn't want to let go of the past. She still says she loves me and would never want him over me, which I believe.\n\nWhat scares me most is how she lied about the whole situation. I feel like my trust for her has been severely violated and I don't know how to move forward. Is this something I should forgive? Or are these signs that she might do something like this in the future and I should get out while I can?","chosen":"Girlfriend lied to me about keeping in contact with an ex, who she claimed was stalking\/harassing her.

{"prompt":"Hey guys, so TIFU in front of all my classmates and didn't realize it until after my teacher pointed it out.\n\nI'm currently taking an intro to psychology class over the summer at my university. Today in class we talked about Motivation and Emotion, covering a chapter per day as usual. One of the topics is the Drive Reduction Theory of Motivation, where physiological needs cause internal drives and the organism acts to satisfy the need, and tension is reduced. We tied it to sex because college kids, and the issues of meeting online people for sex came up (Tinder, Craigslist, Grindr) and then someone compared that scenario to an Uber taxi, since the driver of the Uber is a stranger. I talked about how one Uber driver locked the back doors of his vehicle and started masturbating next to the female passenger.\n\nExcept I made the hand motion while I told the class that the guy was masturbating. \n\nSo my professor busts out laughing, my friends bust out laughing (our class is like 10 people so we're all friends here) and the guys at the end of the table who couldn't see my hand motion asked me to do it again. They probably thought I'd actually SEEN the video and not just heard about it.

{"prompt":"My girlfriend committed simple battery this Spring after punching another woman at a bar in here in Georgia.\n\nA few days after the incident, she was contacted by a police officer who informed her she had a warrant for her arrest.

She was released and went home to await her court date.\n\nFlash forward to last month. She went to court on her scheduled date but was informed that her case was not ready and would be postponed for another three months. She was directed to the solicitor's office, where she was given an Acknowledgement of Court Date document (not sure if that's the actual title, but it included information about the arraignment rescheduling on it). That document, in addition to listing the revised date and time, also lists the charges she's facing. When she looked at the paper, she noticed a new charge had been included alongside the simple battery, masturbation for hire.\n\nNo where, not on the officer's report of the incident, nor the county court case website system, is there any mention of this charge, only on this scheduling document. She contacted her arresting officer, who said he did not arrest her for or charge her for it.\n\nThis document was hand written by someone in the solicitor's office, not printed from a computer, which leads me to believe it's a simple clerical error.\n\nMy question is how can we be certain that this charge was not erroneously added and will be brought up at her arraignment?

I would never of broken up with him if he didn't lie to the point of ridiculousness! \n\nAnyways, He is now in rehab for drugs.

However after that he told me something that worried me; apparently when we first met he hated me as he felt i was stealing his best friend (who is now my best friend) and he has had those types of feelings for all his previous best friends. It worries me because he appears to be very possessive towards his best friends and he wants to keep them all to himself.\n \nhe has also done a number of creepy things like asking a female friend of ours to let him sleep in her bed with her and cuddle. He has also joked about raping me a lot over the few years we were best friends and i always thought he playing up to the fact that everyone at our school called us gay or maybe he liked making uncomfortable jokes like that. \n\nThroughout most of our friendship he has wanted to sleep with me and this is a dude that i have shared bedrooms with and now i'm scared that he may have done something creepy while i was asleep.

{"prompt":"I'm wondering how to handle this situation and if my GF is really ready for a relationship based on some of the things I have seen. She spends a lot of nights over at my place, and I noticed that whenever I went to take a shower before bed, after I came back she would be on my laptop and quickly close down some open tabs. I didn't think much of it the first few times, figuring maybe she was looking at something embarrassing, but then I noticed it turned into an every night thing whenever we spent a few days together.\n\nI checked my browser history, and she is looking at her ex's facebook. Specifically, her ex, and her ex's new girlfriend. I know that she had a rough breakup very shortly before we started dating. She was married to him for 6 years and said that he was very controlling and not a good match for her, and when she wanted to leave he put her through a huge guilt trip and made it difficult. I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. \n\nThat said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.\n\nI don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her. During the day\/evening she will be flirty and talking about all the stuff we're going to do in bed, and then after I get out of the shower and she's been on his Facebook, it's like she's emotionally unavailable the rest of the night.\n\nI really love her though so I want to try and make it work, it's just I'm not sure of the right way to handle this situation.","chosen":"GF is secretly checking her ex's facebook every night, texting\/crying once a week.

My mentor was describing a situation to me where her husband had lied to her about selling one of their vans in order to get an SUV for their growing family.  It was one of those scooby-doo kind of vans that had fuzzy carpet inside.  She forgave him, even though she was really pissed off about 1) him not selling the van and 2) lying about it.  This is context of the van being disputed between them for several years, and it was obvious that their family needed a more family friendly car.

Long story short after I left my 13 year old son decided it would be a good time to jerk off, so he did. In front of my boss and about 20+ other employees on the conference call.

{"prompt":"I am an hourly employee at the corporate office of a large retailer.  My hours are 9am-6pm Monday to Friday.  I have been with the company for almost a year.  A few months after I started working, my boss would call or text me after work hours to ask me to do things.  This happened maybe once a month....  At first I would answer the call and if it was a minor task, I would go ahead and complete it no questions asked.

I have asked for a raise since I am no longer doing one persons job....to only be shot down.  That being said, my enthusiasm in the work place has lessened and the fact that I am so overwhelmed at work makes me not want to have ANYTHING to do with work once I clock out.  That being said, I have stopped answering calls from my boss after hours and he made a comment one day at work about how I never answer his calls anymore on my personal cell phone after work.  I would come up with reasons like I didn't hear the phone ring and it was too late to call back or whatever...\n\nThis past Friday he texted me at 9:30pm while I was out celebrating my sister's birthday and asked me to remote into my workstation to complete a minor task....I finally had enough and I texted back \"Since I am not salaried, I would prefer that you not contact me after hours or on weekends about work.  Thank you and have a great night.\"\n\nHe replied back, \"Sorry to bother you\".  And that was that.\n\nAll day today, he has refused to speak to me, answer any of my emails or return my phone calls....which is not like him at all.  WTF?

{"prompt":"Hi loseit. I've been a lurker here for a while, it's a great place to come to when you feel like you need some motivation to keep on track. I'm not looking to lose as much weight as many people here I think, but the method is the same.\n\nI'm a 5'10\", 19 year-old female, and since last August I've gone from my highest weight of 164 and dropped around ~12 lbs using myfitnesspal. It's been rather slow-going for me since every so often I tend to go over my calorie limit for a couple days before getting back on track, but I think overall I end up with more days where I've eaten my goal amount or I'm under my maintenance calories rather than over.\n\nHowever, it's started to get to the point where I'm getting frustrated, because I just can't seem to get any lower. For nearly the past 2 months I've been wavering between ~154-152 lbs, and it seems that any time I just start to think I'll be making progress, I regain those couple pounds I think I've dropped.\n\nThis morning was very discouraging, because after weighing in at 152.4 lbs last week, I stepped on the scale to have it declare I was at 155.4.\n\nNow, I know that this is kind of silly, since in order to re-gain 3 whole pounds of fat, I would have to eat an excess of 10,500 calories, which I am *quite* certain I haven't done. I know it has to be water weight, but at the same time, it's really disappointing that all this water weight is being added onto my real weight. I mean, last week I must have had some water weight too, right? Yet it still said I was 3 lbs lighter. And the fact that it says so means that I probably haven't lost any fat either, otherwise even with water weight my overall weight would probably be less.\n\nI always weigh myself in the morning, after using the washroom and before eating anything, so that's not the problem.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend and I live in a managed apartment community, have lived here for about two years. We moved to this city in huge part because of the lower living expenses. When we moved in, we were told to expect increases of at least $25 on lease renewal, and last year the rent increased $27 which was *totally* reasonable. Currently we pay $936\/month for a 2\/2, which we split about 40\/60.\n\nThe other day I got a renewal offer in my email, the lowest priced option was $1051\/month, which is an increase of $115 a month and seems unreasonable. I called and spoke to one of the girls in the front office and was told she can regenerate the renewal offer in a week and see if the prices change, but the manager was not around so I couldn't get any more info\n\nWhat's the best course of action here? For background, we are doing okay financially(0 debt, we each have at least a 6 month emergency fund, there's money left over to save each month but not a ton), but we are planning to get married soon and the extra $115 a month is money I had mentally put aside for modest rings and a short honeymoon. Add to that, we will have about $2k in additional expenses in November outside of our regular bills... so the idea of our rent going up after that stresses me out.\n\nMy question is this -- is there anything we can do about this? I've looked up the law where I live and they are within their rights to increase the rent however much they want as long as they give us notice. I have drafted a letter detailing our excellent payment history, how we've never had any problems, mentioning the cost\/risk of new tenants, etc., and suggesting that the max increase we will accept is 5%... but I'm not sure that this would have any effect. The girl I spoke to in the office basically said \"the computer does it\" and that she has no say, but I'm thinking the manager might. Does anyone have any experience with this?

Also, I am not sure how I feel about intimacy. Although we hadn't had any sort of sex yet, I felt that was probably coming soon. I can't decide if it is weird for me at 25 to be nervous or if I'm just a late bloomer and I should get my experience when I can.\n\nBy chance, we ran into each other today while shopping and we had a coffee. I realized how deeply I missed him. He misses me too and wants to get back together.\n\nShould we get back together?

{"prompt":"I (f\/18) was dumped via text by him (m\/18) after a 2.5 year relationship because he was not done 'partying' and felt as if we had growing up to do.

We just recently graduated and plan to attend college this fall (him at a university, me at a small community college about 30 minutes away.)

He showed no signs of disinterest until about a week ago, he started partying more, hanging out with more friends that he normally wouldn't.\n \n\nNow, I had no problem with this, I never asked to join in on his fun time with friends, always offered to be a safe drive home and only asked for simple information in return, when he couldn't produce that information that is when it upset me. He started being shady, putting friends\/getting drunk before me especially at times I really needed him and finally ended it 3 days ago. All these newly developed characteristics are highly unlike him, if he comes back and gets his priorities in check what shall I do? This pattern could stop and then continue in college, yet I know school is a number one priority for him.\n \n\nI understand when he said we needed to grow. We've been together most of our high school years.

However after that he told me something that worried me; apparently when we first met he hated me as he felt i was stealing his best friend (who is now my best friend) and he has had those types of feelings for all his previous best friends. It worries me because he appears to be very possessive towards his best friends and he wants to keep them all to himself.\n \nhe has also done a number of creepy things like asking a female friend of ours to let him sleep in her bed with her and cuddle. He has also joked about raping me a lot over the few years we were best friends and i always thought he playing up to the fact that everyone at our school called us gay or maybe he liked making uncomfortable jokes like that. \n\nThroughout most of our friendship he has wanted to sleep with me and this is a dude that i have shared bedrooms with and now i'm scared that he may have done something creepy while i was asleep.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 11 months, the first few months of which we lived in the same city. He recently moved away for work and we are now living in different countries.\n\n  If I had my way we would be texting trough out the day because that's just the way I operate and when something noteworthy happens, he is the first I want to tell. That doesn't go over well with him because he feels like I am bombarding him and he can't get other things done, which I'm fine with. I've been trying to keep my texting to minimum. \n\n We've also had other issues where he was feeling suffocated when I wanted to spend the night with him most nights, but we worked through it.\n\n So right now we are trying to make this long distance thing work and I know he doesn't like to text or be texted a lot so I suggested (after reading a whole bunch of long distance relationship tips online) that the first person to wake up or go to bed would text the other goodnight or good morning.

The \"date\" went extremely well and I did have a wonderful time with her and although I really do like her, I get the impression it's one sided.\n\nDuring the date, I told her that I considered this a date and whatnot and well I feel like I've put my foot in my mouth.

There are plans for my son and I to move there in the near future.)\n\nHe's gainfully employed, owns his own home, doesn't have any real emotional baggage. He's attractive and a genuinely good person. No complaints on the sexy-times front. Yeah, he has quirks such as being a D&D-level nerd, but I knew all about that stuff before we dated. His shameless nerding is actually one of the things I love about him. He adores my 11 year old son and my son adores him.  He's not rich by any means, but spoils me by cooking Sunday breakfast for us when I've had a hard week at work. He remembers things I like and then surprises me with something small related to that (e.g. I'm a huge Cubs fan, he surprised me with a Cubs keychain when my old one broke).\n\nI was married to my son's father (now divorced, obviously) and not sure I ever want to marry again. He's never been married and is absolutely fine with not getting married if I don't want to. He has his own friends, he's not clingy or jealous.

She doesn't live near us, so I have only met her a couple of times, over a short period. I thought we got on well. She loved me, because I am \"rich and pretty\" (her words - I'm not rich, and pretty is subjective). My boyfriend and I went on an expensive vacation that we'd both saved up for. It was amazing. It was then that she started making derogatory comments. Saying that it was a waste of money etc. Then suddenly I was no longer invited to family events.

{"prompt":"First time on here. I (m28) with my girlfriend (f28) for 10yrs+. We broke up for about a year a couple of years back (1 kid at this stage) obviously both went off on the single scene.\n\nWe got back together and had another kid together. Recently I found out she was with a guy that she worked with years ago. They had been \"friends\" and texting each other on and off over the years. But when  we weren't together she ended up sleeping with this guy. He had a girlfriend at the time, think he still does.\n\nI recently confronted my partner about this and she told me that she didn't see any harm in texting him when we were together originally because \"nothing happened\". I'm finding it hard to believe that a guy would keep interest after 8 yrs (when they originally met) if he wasn't getting anywhere (unless they were just friends)\n\nUsually if this was one of my friends in this situation, I'd say fuck her. But the problem is we have 2 children and I can't bear the thought of not seeing them everyday. Or them growing up in a broken home.\n\nI don't know whether to believe what she is telling me or what to do. I can't think properly about the whole situation, I'm lost! \n\nTo make it worse, I found out where the guy lives and the temptention to fuck him up is going through my head.

{"prompt":"I've posted before about what was going on at the end of my previous relationship, and how I ended it because he'd cheated on me in the past, had been acting extremely suspiciously and then when we broke up and I was still in the house, slept with someone in our bed, which I overheard.\n\nI can't help but feel extremely guilty, despite the fact he's done all that to me. He's contacted me a bit since I left, saying he's ruined his life, he can't believe what he did and would take it all back if he could. What made me particularly sad was when he said he'd imagined us growing old together. It's really sad to think that that could have happened but because of some mistakes he made, which I just couldn't deal with, that will never happen. There was a lot of other stuff he did, like making me feel really bad about myself (making fun of my appearance, things like that). He was also violent a couple of times.\n\nSo yeah, I know it sounds really stupid that I'd feel any guilt after all that, but I do feel really sad for him. He's not had an easy life and is dealing with some health stuff which is quite difficult (I think he has some mental health issues which weren't being addressed, too). I sometimes have thoughts that I didn't give it enough of a chance, but I did take him back after the initial cheating and nothing really changed, plus I could have been in actual danger had I stayed.\n\nSo yeah, no question here really but I could just do with a bit of reassurance\/people chipping in on their own thoughts and experiences right now.

Our plan was to move in together within the next couple of months. We even talked about it one more time on my last day in Seattle. He said that he isn't ready and that we should wait a bit more. I was crushed because I was set on moving and everything seemed perfect. When I landed in LA, we talked on the phone and he told me that there's something missing in our relationship and that we seemed \"different\" when I was in Seattle. Like we are not clicking. I knew something was different, but I just thought it was him. But apparently, there was something different between us. I'm so confused. Does he still like me? I don't understand. He's been chasing me for so long and now that he has me, he's not really trying? I still want to be with him, but I dont know if Im willing to wait for him to be \"ready\" He told me to give him some time to think about it, but at this point..if he's already having doubts...isnt it over?

We have fortunately had a very strong relationship with few fights. To add a little background, I am a member of a fraternity in college, and I am graduating this semester. I understand this is a controversial topic, but please see me through. A tradition of greek life is to buy a girl who means a lot to you a \"lavaliere\", a piece of jewelry containing the greek letters. However, I am unable to completely afford this before I graduate. I have elected to buy her the necklace chain that this charm will go on.\n\nHowever, she has a metal allergy, which I have not had completely explained by her. From what I know, she is able to tolerate gold jewelry, but not gold plated jewelry.  I don't want to ask her because I'd prefer to surprise her.\n\nWhat I am asking is, does anyone in this sub have any familiarity with this issue, and if so, what karat of gold is reasonable?

Then, I got a job, worked my ass off and got promoted to full time. His contract was over and now he's looking for work again. I pay for everything now, with the deal that he will pay me back his half later. He said he would pay half of the rent out of his savings. \n  He's applied for about two hundred jobs, with no leads. He's been late giving me rent for the last two months, and he still owes me one hundred from last month. When I tried to explain that I was worried he didn't respect how important rent is, he quickly got upset, and stormed off into the night to find an ATM. Over the phone, i've begged him to come home- it's about 2am here- but he maintains that I just want his money, and \"everything is about money\" to me. For the record, it's not, I would pay all of the rent if he told me ahead of time he couldn't afford it. I'm worried about him walking for miles in a strange city so late. \n\n His ego has been wrecked lately, because of lack of work and unhappiness with his appearance. He dislikes how he looks because his hair has gotten shaggy, but he doesn't have money to cut it, and refuses my offer to pay for one. I think I may have hit a sore spot when I asked about the rent. He has been feeling inadequate lately, and this may have rubbed salt in his wounds. \n\n  How can I go about his better in the future? How do I know if i'm being taken advantage off?

I've tried to tell her to take nap when she gets home so we could spend more time in the evening, trying to give her a hint, but she always refuses.\n She doesn't get why it's such a big deal for me, and says that me being to frustrated makes her want sex even less.","chosen":"Girlfriend and i haven't had sex in a while and it really bothers me, it bothers her how frustrated i am.","rejected":"GF is getting frustrated with me because i think the lack of sex is a big deal for me, and it's getting to the point where i don't feel like cuddling with her because i know i'll want to make a move"}
{"prompt":"I have been dating my boyfriend for 2 1\/2 years. His ex-gf (first love) who he was still friends with but wanted to date again died about 3 years ago. He has a tattoo in memory of her and art and things she made him hung up in his room and car. The first year we dated was touch and go as to if he was ready to be in a relationship. I tried to be there for him as much as I could but it was hard for a beginning of a relationship. We have since moved forward and are in a very good place. I had been OK with her things everywhere because I knew it was understandable....he was grieving and it was not my place. Now we are moving in together and I feel weird having her things hung up in our place.

Now I had not seen the saloon but all I knew was that it was downstairs.

I had enough and decided to go downstairs to see if we were going home, so I could play the masterpiece of the game that is Fallout. Now, I had gotten down the stairs and went inside to a store without reading the sign.

After a one year break , I decided that I had to do something in my life , and I ended up in a private CS (Computer Science ) college. \n\u00a0\n\nMy boyfriend , followed the same process as me , but he got in a national Technical School ( maybe that's the wrong term  ,but here we have : universities > technical schools , as we call them , or as I roughly translate at least :P ). He is now on his 10th year and he has to pass 1 lesson to get his degree. He is interested in computers , which has nothing to do with what he used to study.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n**The problem** : Well the obvious problem is that he thinks I'm getting a degree no matter what , because my father's paying a bunch of money. The other problem is that he thinks I'm stupid he explains the most basic stuff like he would explain it to a 4 year old.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nFor example: \"You cannot do [insert paragraph here] with this command, the database doesn't allow it\" .

{"prompt":"So I've been chatting on fb almost weekly for substantial periods of time (20 min - 1 hr) with a boy who graduated from my school last year for almost a year now and I can't tell if he actually enjoys our conversations or feels obligated to respond and wishes I would leave him alone. I've been able to see him in person a couple of times since he left for college (once when I visited his city and asked and once when he came back and said he'd try to see me, which he did.) over Christmas break I tried to see him and he was busy (legitimately so, I believe, but there was no mention of trying another time) and when I messaged him he took much longer than usual to reply so I decided not to try contacting him in case he was trying to get rid of me (I almost always start the conversation.) A little over two weeks later, he messaged me and we talked for about an hour. I messaged him about a week after to say our school had posted a baby photo of him (he's the son of two teachers, that's why it was posted) and we talked for a while. There wasn't a clear ending to the conversation as we seemed to miss when the other was online but we were having a good conversation when he just stopped responding. It's been three days and he hasn't even read the message. \n\nI can't figure out what's going on here. Does he actually want to be friends or does he just like talking to me when he's bored or am\nI the annoying girl who can't take a hint? Can I ask about it? I'm worried to say anything because it'll probably come off as needy (and maybe it is) and I'll look extremely insecure but at the same time I'm tired of constantly wondering about this. I hate that I get worked up waiting for him to reply and I'd just like to know what he's thinking so I know if it's even worth it to continue making an effort to be friends. \n\nWhat should I do?

{"prompt":"Hey guys,\n\nI'm an 18 year old high school student who's in their final year. About 2 months ago I was accepted to my dream school, and as such I'll be going off their in August. I'm extremely happy about it, it's one of the best schools in my country, and the place itself is beautiful. Needless to say, this relatively early university acceptance was a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. \n\nBut for whatever reason, I can't find it in myself to be happy. Most kids my age would be ecstatic and hopeful for the future. And while I am happy that I'll be moving out on my own, I can't help but feel incredible emptiness. Every night I just waste away the day browsing internet forums or listening to music. My usual hobby of videogames can't grip me like it used to; any time I try a new game I lose interest after a few hours, maybe a few days if I'm lucky. The only thing that can hold my attention for more than a few days is reading books, but even with that, I have to take a break every half hour or else I zone out.\n\nDo you guys have any advice for me? I have nothing to be sad about, my life is great as it is, but at the same time I don't feel happy about anything. I usually feel comfortable with my friends, but we've been talking less and less recently, due to conflicting schedules at school.","chosen":"Going to a dream school, moving out early on, having trouble feeling happy despite having everything I want.

{"prompt":"Bare with me, its pretty long.\n\nAlright, so my gf has had a troubled past; she was raped when she was thirteen by a \"friend\" and as a result, her family completely fell apart. Her father actively despises her for this, her twin brother is an addict, and her parents are seeking a divorce. Her entire life since that incident has been a nightmare, and it shows in her relationships which have ended in her getting used and cheated on. Despite this she is very tough and resilient, but i think that stubbornness has run out.\n\nShe is very depressed and tells me how she has had enough and doesn't care anymore. her tumultuous relationship with her father is at the core of this. She dropped out of high school and just recently got her GED to show her dad she is willing to give schooling a second chance. The agreement was she would go to school and he would give her her car back. But he went back on his word and just yells at her and puts her down whenever she brings it up.\n\nSo now she's jobless without a car to take her to work and school and basically incapable of sustaining herself because of it. On top of that her dad kicked her out of the house for getting a tattoo, while her twin brother is an addict who comes home fucked up on god knows what. She's been living with my uncle since she is childhood friends with my cousin, but she has become completely depressed and demotivated. She feels like her situation is hopeless and has told me she doesnt care anymore.

{"prompt":"This girl (we'll call her Claire) was my first gf ever back in hs. We dated for about a year but distance drew us apart. Our breakup was a little messy and for a few years we didn't talk. Fast forward and we began texting again 'as friends'. We both moved back to our hometown after college and I expected us to have a great friendship, as that's what we both wanted. In my eyes a friendship would consist of hanging out, doing things together, etc.\n\nEver since she moved home she refuses to hang out with me one on one, as she believes it's 'too close to bf\/gf'. As much as I would try to get closer with her she would equally push me away. However, her and I text all day every day, she tells me all of her closest secrets and innermost thoughts, we talk on the phone about her problems etc.\n\nI'm really confused about all of this. She treats me 'like a boyfriend' via text\/phone but she treats me as LESS THAN a friend in person. I finally decided to bring my frustrations up to her and mention that 'it's our last year possibly ever in the same state (before grad school) and that I wished things went differently etc. She took this as me confessing my love and told me 'too bad but I don't feel the same way.' Basically a generic 'friend-zone' response that she has sent to multiple guys before.\n\nI really don't know what to do anymore but it's wearing on me. I have tried to bring things up to talk about what relationship we have and she completely blows me off month after month. And yet I'm still there anytime she needs to talk about issues or even other bf issues (which i told her to not bring up to me multiple times) On one hand I feel like I need to do what's best for me.

I could tell something was wrong and I asked, she said that she wasn't happy after yesterday. I apologized and told her how much an idiot I know I was etc. The more we messaged the more serious it seemed to become, I asked if I could see her tomorrow before work so we could talk and she told me she didn't want to see me right now.

{"prompt":"All right, here's the deal. When the semester started, I met this girl in my Chem lab and we started talking. Infrequently for a while, but around a month ago started to pick up to the point that it was every day for the past few weeks. Anyway, I was very much into this girl. She's very pretty, and shares so many interests with me, it was a little surreal. \n\nTwo weeks ago we went on a date, which went really well, we ended up kissing at the end and I was a happy man. Ideally we would have had a second date this weekend or last, but it was easter and she went home, and this weekend is out for other reasons. So here's the problem. Starting earlier this week, our contact started to taper off, effectively not talking whatsoever this week. Obviously I was a little concerned, given how much we'd been talking before, so I said I'd like to talk to her, and she said she wanted to talk to me as well. \n\nSo we talk on the phone a bit, and here's the issue. She tells me that she wasn't sure if we were a couple or not (something we hadn't discussed, and I wasn't clear on either), and that she didn't feel ready to be in a couple. She said that she was still emotional over her last breakup, and she didn't feel emotionally ready to be in a relationship with me yet. This is followed by saying that she does really like me and wants to keep hanging out and talking and all that jazz. I of course understand that you can't control feeling not ready, and told her that, and saying that while disappointed, I wouldn't guilt trip her or pressure her into anything. \n\nAnyway, the vibe that I got was that a relationship wasn't off the table, just not right now. I feel that any relationship we would have would be a healthy, lengthy, and fulfilling one. So I suppose my wondering here is what I should do to make it clear that I am open to a relationship and fostering that relationship potential, while maintaining the friendship and giving her the time she needs.","chosen":"Was very into this girl, had a great date, but contact has faded off since, don't know if we should pursue relationship, how to make clear I am open to a relationship while maintaining the friendship and giving her the time she needs","rejected":"Girl and I have been getting close, but she says she's not ready to be in a relationship yet.

We see eachother everyday, common interests everywhere, amazing sex, etc.  Problem is that in about a week, my work is sending me to Japan for 5 months.

We've both said that we aren't going to be looking for anyone else while I'm gone, but that we can't really apply any labels once I leave.\n\nThat being said, my work is not only paying for all of my airfare, but they are also giving me a pretty hefty bonus for going there (about $20,000 plus incidentals and living expenses).  She has toyed with the idea of getting a ticket and coming to visit me, but I know the cost is a big concern (its about $1200-1400 from where we live).\n\nWould it be weird for me to offer to go in on it with her or pay for half or something?

{"prompt":"I have been with this guy for 2 years. Yesterday, he told me that before we go any further in the relationship, I should know that he is very manipulative. I haven't even thought of him like that before. So obviously, the first thing I did was go on Google to see if anyone else has been in my situation before. I couldn't find anything similar, but I found a lot of articles on how to see if your partner is a manipulator. Most of the things on the manipulator check list aren't in our relationship. However, I spotted 2 that is very obvious: I am almost always wrong in any argument we have and he points out things about myself that I should improve. However, I have never really felt any emotional distress in the time period I was with him. One thing I notice however is that he puts a lot of emphasis on how he looks (grooming, clothing) and yet very little emphasis on appearances of things like car or house. Basically, I am just really confused. I don't understand why he told that he is manipulative and yet, I can't find convincing signs that he is. Maybe he doesn't understand what manipulative means ? Maybe it's some next level manipulation ? Maybe I am just too blind to see it ? He often tells me that I am too naive and that I shouldn't trust people so easily, him included.

{"prompt":"I am currently in Lima. Long story short, my bags got lost in Mexico City and I only received them last night. 5 days without anything kind of drained my budget pretty quickly and I need to get to Cuzco in the next few days. I have found it is pretty difficult to find out about bus companies without actually going to the bus station. The hostel I am staying in, The Point, only gives me times and prices for Cruz del Sur. It is a very safe and comfortable company, but a little bit more than I would like to pay. Also, just going to the bus station to check it out is an option, but that is another 20-30 soles I would rather not spend. I have about 115 Soles in my pocket and about 500 more available to me for about the next 8 days.  Even if I could get the ball rolling and find a cheap bus to Ica or Huacachina. The safer the better, obviously.

I would wake up to him fingering me or even as he was starting to penetrate me. Each time this happened I would tell him it made me feel terrible and please don't do it again. But he would still do it. His excuse was that he didn't know I was asleep and he thought I was into it.\n\nThere are some other issues aside from this, but generally he is a kind, supportive, encouraging person.

He's sweet, caring, tolerant, liberal, basically every single thing on my 'checklist', if I had one, is there. \n\nThe problem, though, is he talks VERY slowly. I mean his speed is really slow. If I ask him anything, he takes about 3 seconds before he starts to talk, then when he starts, the words go at a very slow pace,and he even pauses for 3-5 seconds in the middle of his sentence. I get really impatient and sometimes just feel like telling him to hurry up (of course I don't, but I really feel like doing so). \n\nI asked him today, very gently, why he spoke so slow, and he said he just gets thoughts very slowly in his brain. He then went on to say he's just generally slow at thinking. I felt really sad when he said this, I don't know why. He's a Math PhD student,and we are at a pretty good school, and his research has been going slow for a while now (but this is totally normal in grad school), so I think that response was kind of a self-deprecating one since he's already low on self-esteem. \n\nAnyway, my point is, his speed of talking is just a part of him, it can't be changed. I love him so much otherwise but I just want to know how to deal with this. Conversation is so important in a relationship! How do we manage?

Before graduation, we decided to live together and share a car after graduation before one of us going to buy another car if we find a job. We are going to buy from a friend who is going to move to another state.\n\nAfter graduation, I travelled for a while with my parents. She moved into the house in December while my lease for my current apartment ends on January 22nd. During my travel, I checked in on her about the house and car situation. She said she does not have money yet to buy the car. Today, I texted her that I will pay up the car first because I need it and she can pay me up later. She decided to text me a long message.

{"prompt":"So my ex gf and I dated for about 6 months. We hit things off really well and found we have incredibly similar tastes, hobbies, interests, etc, but failed to be compatible personality-wise. It was my first relationship so I had a good deal to learn and I wasn't exactly the fastest learner.\n\nAnyways, we jumped into the relationship very quickly, after maybe a month of talking, and had sex very soon. The beginning was nothing like I had anticipated and we had a ton of road bumps along the way but were always able to patch things up. Things eventually got much better after a big fight and we were together all the time and loved each other's company. Towards the end of the relationship I felt her pulling away. I consider myself the jealous type and I think that's for a couple of reasons: I have always been put down for my looks and developed a generally lower self-esteem, and also because she was insanely hot. From the moment she caught my eye till today, she has always been the most beautiful girl I have seen, and I always made sure she knew that. So my jealousy of whenever she'd talk to other guys was definitely something that was always present.\n\nBasically now it's all over and we're not even near each other distance-wise. I find myself missing her more every day and we still talk like friends but I just don't think I'll ever get over her...

He can flirt for tips all he wants but kissing crosses the line. He has plenty of other tricks. Hundred of them. He agreed. However, a week ago he was doing a wedding and ended up going a kiss trick on a bridesmaid who asked him to, who had seen the trick done by another magician before.

The emails included pictures of her in a sexual nature. We fought and he told me his reason for doing it was that we hadn't had sex yet and he was horny. \n\nThe reason we hadn't had sex yet was because I was not on birth control and he had never said anything about wanting to so I thought it wasn't that big of a deal. He was always shutting down my advances because \"he was tired.\" He never initiates and hasn't initiated in over two years. He then tells me he doesn't find me attractive when I'm anything but happy. \n\nGreat. It's been over a year since all that happened.

We started having sex, but he still never initiates and is always \"too tired.\" I constantly feel like he's not attracted to me. I feel so unloved and ugly right now. He gets defensive if I try to talk to him about it, or he tells me he'll try more and nothing happens.\n\nI know this is a mixture of my faults and his.

I'd play games, learn some code until I was tired which was usually until about half 12.  \n\nMy girlfriend is always tired and wakes up early for her job, she's usually up at 7 and out of the house by 8.

{"prompt":"Hey Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me out with this one.  \nSo, here's the story so far: I'm friends with a girl (she is a good friend of my girlfriend) who, from my point of view, is a bit in a rough spot right now. She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).\n  \nSo, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  \nThere is just one problem though: no fucking.  \n\nYou might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird. My friend has tried her best to initiate any kind of affectionate interaction. The closest was her grabbing his dick. He just laughed in return, said that he is a little bit tired and then they proceeded to hug each other and fall asleep (oh yeah they did make out once but did not proceed to sexual intercourse, since this bloke used the same excuse to \"get out of it\")  \nSo, despite them seeing each other every day, despite clear initiatives coming from her side, nothing has happened yet. Weirder yet, my friend has totally fallen for this guy. The bloke doesn't seem to show clear signs of affection. But why would he then continue to see her every other day? Am I just over-analyzing stuff?

If he would go to visit her, I wasn't welcome. It got worse. To summarize the next couple of months: it got worse until she ended up making him pick between me or her. I have no clue why. Long story short we are happy together and he has cut her off, but it wasn't without a lot of hassle including death threats to us both, and I think my boyfriend is very traumatized by what happened, although he won't talk about it.\n\nSince then we have had no contact apart from she sent him a Christmas card. However. I am SO scared she will come back. I worry that she will manipulate him into leaving me, and do terrible things to us. What can I do to get over this?

{"prompt":"Me (M29) and my wife (F29) have been married for just one year, and had dated for four prior. Over this past year, we were lacking in the intimacy department. This was my fault, I foolishly thought that our emotional connection was enough and didn't need sex as much. I was quite wrong and now understand that. \n\nAnyway, this led my wife to feel rejected by me and she fell out of love.

This sounds bad I know. But I understand how it got to this point.  She is trying to give us a chance, and things are getting better (sleeping in the same bed again, I get a kiss goodbye in the morning, spend time together after we get home from work etc), but she still has feelings for him, and seemingly slightly less feelings for me.  We had a fight about it, I yelled (which I have never done in an argument during my adult life), but I told her that I forgive her even though it hurts. \n\nShe says she cares a great deal about me, but is having a hard time loving me again after being rejected so many times.  \n\nWe're starting marriage counseling next week, and she seems optimistic about it.

Then, when he came back, I was talking to a girlfriend on the phone and overheard my mom asking him to apologize. He said she couldn't make him do anything and he LEFT AGAIN. He called my mom an hour ago to say he was staying at his mothers for the night (not unusual, he's her caretaker, but still). \n\nI don't know what to do or say or even what kind of advice I'm expecting.

As soon as word got to him about the two of us, he began calling her phone and leaving very threatening voice-mails and demanding answers to some very private questions.\n\nShortly after that ordeal he got a hold of my number.

{"prompt":"Throwaway account, just because.\n\nFor three weeks last month I was traveling for work. An old friend contacted me right before I left, asking if she could stay with me while doing job interviews nearby. I told her that I wouldn't be around but that I would give her free access to my apartment. She ended up staying for two weeks and left the place in great shape. However, I'm just getting around to paying my bills for that period and I realized that my utilities bill is MUCH higher than usual. I've never seen my bill this high before and fall usually has the cheapest months because the climate is so neutral. Unlike most apartment buildings that I know of, each unit is responsible for it's own utilities, meaning that every bill I receive is for my own apartment's usage (instead of a total cost that is split between all of the tenants throughout the building). She was the only one in the apartment for the majority of that period. I thought I was doing the right thing by letting her use my place for free, but now I'm wondering if I should bring this up. \n\nIf I'm ever in a position again where I let someone use my apartment, should I make some sort of stipulation about energy usage?

{"prompt":"My boyfriend and I (Both 24) have been in a relationship for 2 years and a couple months now. Things had been going quite well, until last night he brought up that he's been having a feelings of 'what if.'\n\nFor the majority of the relationship we were long distance, but saw each other every other weekend. 3 weeks ago, we moved in with each other since we both now have jobs in the same area. Things seemed to be going pretty well. Then, throughout the last week, I noticed he wasn't hugging, kissing, touching me and things seemed strained for him. Finally, he let out that since I'm his first girlfriend, he is having feelings of 'what if there's someone better out there for me? How do I even know what I want since I've never dated anyone else?' and various related questions.\n\nI flat out asked him if he wanted to end things, but he constantly says \"I don't know, part of me wants to stay and part of me doesn't know\" (which I assume means part of him wants to leave). Upon prying a little more, he said that sometimes he feels like we are too similar and neither of us pushes the other to go out and do things... But this is untrue in my eyes. For the past 2 months, we have not had a free weekend because of going out and doing things. I also just moved into the area and started my first job, so I have been swamped with getting things in order (but trust me, I would love to go out and do things).\n\nMy question: How do I help him figure out what's best for him?

Class began and the feminist in question raised her hand and asked why women can't be priests, he began to respond but she cut him off and began lecturing him about how it was sexist, unfair, doltish, and threatened all the rights of women. She continued lecturing him for the next 40 minutes, he didn't get to say a word. Today, in theology class, she began yelling at our teacher about how everything she believed was wrong and how she was a disgrace against humanity.

{"prompt":"So a little background first: I'm on my school's student council, and today was our Junior Prom assembly. We had a lot going on, much of it relying on a fast internet connection to work (live cameras streamed over AppleTV, etc.) we realized that as everyone settled into the auditorium, we'd have a large portion of the student body connecting to the school wifi, and we were worried about slowdown. Our live camera was basically useless without a good internet connection, so I had the bright idea to hook up the AppleTV to my personal hotspot. It connected automatically, I ran the feed for a few seconds, worked like a charm, so we moved on. Assembly starts, about 15 minutes in and everything is going great. I'm backstage when I see our principal run up to microphone and tell everyone to exit the school immediately, as there is a potential terror threat in the area (I live in an area where things like this never happen; we've had one lockdown in my 10 years of schooling here) obviously, everyone's more than a little worried. Everyone files out, myself included. As I'm standing outside, a friend walks up and tells us what he found out from a teacher. One of the students, while trying to connect to the wifi, had \"discovered\" a network... My network: \"Taliban Secure Communications.\" needless to say, the student went to a teacher, things escalated, and the school ordered a full evacuation. I talked to the principal (a very, very awkward conversation) and got everything sorted out. Everyone's parents are panicking, checking their kids out of school now. My personal hotspot is now called \"I love school.\"","chosen":"Turned on personal hotspot with the name \"Taliban Secure Communications\" for an assembly, school got evacuated because of a supposed terror threat.","rejected":"Hooked up personal hotspot to school wifi, student discovered it was used for secure communications by the Taliban, evacuated school, personal hotspot now called \"I love school\"."}
{"prompt":"This was a couple of years ago, approaching Christmas in 2012. I had a really bad habit of not locking the door to my flat, and had the idea that it might bite me in the arse one day.\n\nSo it was a Wednesday night, student night and me and the girlfriend were lying in bed. We could hear some goings on in the corridor but thought nothing of it really, it sounded like somebody had come back drunk and was having trouble getting into their flat. Eventually we hear a door close, it sounded quite close. The girlfriend turns to me and asks was it ours. I was sure it wasn't and so we ignored it.\n\nNext thing we know, a girl wearing just a t-shirt and knickers walks into our bedroom. I jump out of bed and instruct her to leave, she instructs us to leave claiming that it's her flat. She then leaves our room and uses our toilet. (At this point I'm like, wtf I do?). Being a gentleman, I wait for her to finish her business, then tell her again to leave, block her from entering our kitchen\/living room, she gets confrontational, and me, not wanting to touch that, do nothing to stop her going in there. Try a bit more to get her to leave, then call the police cause girl wearing next to nothing and clearly drunk is not a thing I want to tackle.\n\nMe and the girlfriend then spend some time waiting for the police to arrive, in the meantime this girl eats some of the lunch I left out for taking to work, drinks some of my rum, then throws up all over the blinds. The police arrived a couple of hours later. I was left to clean up her sick.","chosen":"I ignored a drunk girl in my flat, she came in, drank some of my food and threw up, police showed up and I was left to clean up her vomit.","rejected":"TIFU by not locking my door, some drunk girl walks in without knocking, doesn't leave when told to, ends up sick on my kitchen blinds."}

I broke it off with her because of various personality problems that aren't relevant to this story.\n\nSince the breakup, she's posted Facebook updates every few days that are barbed, backhanded insults. We were poly (well, she was; I never dated outside of the relationship), and she'll post updates about how great her current partner is, especially compared to \"some of her exes,\" and referring to details of our relationship that I'm sure to get. I'm sure you've seen this sort of behavior, someone talking about how great things are now compared to *before,* how great it is to be finally understood, etc.\n\nSo I know it would be trouble to engage with this; it's probably what she wants. I've unsubscribed, so I can only see her updates when I look for them, which I do out of morbid curiosity every three or four days. Most of the time, they just cement my convictions about making the right choice in leaving her. Others, it makes me feel crappy, because sometimes the things she says have a grain of truth. There's a part of me that thinks not blocking her is a point of pride; I'm showing that I don't care. Another part of me thinks it might make me feel better to block her.

I really do love him, and want to forgive him and move passed it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAt first he was really apologetic, and wanted to do anything to make it up to me again.

{"prompt":"I am not good for figuring out presents for myself but I recently saw this ring online that caught my attention. It's not entirely expensive, about $120.

This always upset him because he said he doesn't like traditional romance and she would berate him for it calling him a bad boyfriend and saying things like \"he must not really love her.\" Besides her, he also isn't religious and doesn't want us to mingle money because he feels it would cause more arguments partially due to us having very different spending styles. All of this is fine with me (I actually earn more than he does). But I am rambling a bit. Should I just show him the ring?

{"prompt":"Ok so this was actually my mom that f'd up.  Some preface: I am on the swim team, and I wear a speedo (don't like jammers).  If you are a person that has hit puberty and you wear a swimsuit like that, you need to make sure there isn't any, you know, visible.  We were at dinner today, and we got talking about razors because my younger brother is starting to grow enough facial hair to need to shave.  I have a super cheap electric razor that is pretty rough, and so I have to be really careful so as to not get any razerburn on my face, and super uber careful so as to not get any in \"other places\", for which I mainly use the flip out trimmer on the back of it because it doesn't need to be perfect, just good enough.  Well, my mom was saying that since I had such a cheap razor, and there was a costco coupon for a nicer one, I could get a nicer one along with my brother.  I was pretty happy about this, because it would be nicer to not feel like I am scratching my face when I shave, and that it would be nice for other places too because, as a swimmer, I need to keep things under control.  As I said this, her eyes grew wide and she metaphorically sh!t her pants.  I was confused, and then she uttered \"I.. uh.. used that razor\".  I was startled, and asked why and where.  She said she used it to shave her face on occasion (because women get some fuzz too, just much more slowly) and that it was because I left it out on the counter and it was the first one she saw.  I laughed pretty hard, and she was not that enthused.  After making it clear that she should use my dad's razor, she promised she would never use it again.","chosen":"Parents, never borrow your teenage children's razors, especially if they are swimmers, because it has probably been places that would make you avoid it like the plague.","rejected":"Mom used my 18 y\/o son's razor to shave her face, and I am now the laughing stock of the family."}
{"prompt":"We have been together for 2 years. When we first got together he had never had a proper gf before and mostly slept around. I knew he was a huge fan of porn and in the first few months of the relationship I was fine with it. Once we got to know each other more I was able to express my feelings about his porn watching and he told me I was being insecure and that the girls didn't compare to me. However, I offer him sex or blowjobs every day.\n\nHe knows how upset I get and burst into tears when I found out he had searched porn. He told me he doesn't deserve me because I'm \"such a good person\" but to be honest, I don't feel I am because I made him feel this way. I don't ever want to see him like that again and it took me by total surprise. The only reason I get so upset about it is because he knows the names of porn actressess and searches them. This makes it more personal to me. I noticed he has liked the actressess on facebook which really annoys me. I get jealous of him jerking off to Divas in WWE.\n\nI wish I didn't feel this way and I don't want him to feel this way either. If it's what he wants to do then I have no right to stop him. I can't help how I feel about it and it will never go. Sometimes I think I need to find someone who doesn't watch it at all. I love this boy more than anything and he has stopped watching it because he loves me too but I don't feel right about it.\n\nI understand it's common for people of our day and age to jerk off to porn. It upsets me him looking at them. Maybe if it was more random I wouldn't mind so much but he searches for women with massive asses and huge tits. This makes me feel more insecure because I don't have either.\n\nPlease provide some advice to help me stop being so jealous.","chosen":"My boyfriend watches porn and it bothers me because he knows the names of porn actressess and searches them on facebook.

{"prompt":"Okay... Long story short.\n\nMy wife was a school teacher but hated her life. At this time i was working full time and working on my degree. Well things flip flopped around and I ended up going to part time at work because I needed 50 credit hours to graduate and it was either get it done in one year or, because of prereqs, get it done in 2 1\/2. After I moved to part time we got pregnant (planned) and my wife decided that she couldn't do the teaching thing anymore so she switched jobs. We were not thinking of the insurance implications. \n\nWe went from $90 a month to $750 for the three of us... thats right $750. We tried to split it up because coverage for her and the baby is $320 and my employer will offer me insurance for $380. We still couldnt budget that. So i go to the healthcare.gov website and apply but because my employer offers coverage i get no discount. I am now officially paying $175 for the worlds worst insurance only to avoid paying premium increase on our house and car insurance as well as the stupid tax for not having any. At this point I am wondering if it is even worth it to have a job because even though I would lose my part time income of 29k we could save 12k per year in day care costs and who knows, maybe get free health care (this of course really isn't an option)\n\nI would like to know if there is some sort of advocacy service that can help me navigate the insurance system so that I can get my family affordable insurance without paying over 15% of our annual  income.\n\nSorry if this comes across ranty but i just get discouraged when two people who try to plan, go to school, contribute to society, and stay employed end up getting shafted this hard when they simply want to get a pair of glasses and some back adjustments.","chosen":"I can no longer afford insurance for myself and my family and wonder if there is some sort of advocacy service that can help navigate the insurance system so that I can get my family affordable insurance without paying over 15% of our annual income.","rejected":"I can no longer afford health insurance for myself and my family, am I justified in hoping that someone can help me navigate the insurance system and get my family affordable health insurance?"}

He asked what I wanted and I said I liked surprises but showed him a few styles of necklaces I liked on etsy (being very careful that they weren't super expensive, all about 20-40$ because we are both college students and can't really be spending a ton)\n\nI asked him what he wanted and he said the only thing he wanted was a mandolin. Well, that's pretty expensive so I asked if there was anything else he wanted (hoping it was something more affordable) He was like well I want (blank very expensive guitar) guitar but that is kind of a lot of $  but I also want a mandolin which would be less expensive.\n\nSo whatever. He links me to the kind of mandolin he wants on musiciansfriend and the cheapest with reasonably good ratings is 150$ wtf.

{"prompt":"I've been thinking a lot about automated manufacturing\/services, and how it is poised to permeate into all aspects of our society.

Why pay a human being who will most likely get fatigued, burnt out, or demand better pay\/working conditions when they can be replaced by machines that only require basic maintenance?\n\nIt will be interesting to see how society and the economy adapts, as automation will turn us on our head. Especially when you think about basic economics, if potentially billions of people are going to be put out of a job in the next twenty years, they will no longer have income. Without income they can no longer buy the products being manufactured, which in turn would cause product manufacturing to recede on all fronts.

My previous trips out of the country have all been to either Europe or the Caribbean and while I enjoyed them I am looking for something different this time. I really like the outdoors, wildlife, and thrill seeking. I used to swim and love all forms of water, but also enjoy a good mountain or rain forest.

On one hand, I want to be \"over\" him and feeling good by the time school comes around (October) so that I can make new friends and focus on academics.\n\nBut the problem is, I'm leaving to go to my home country for one month (all of August). I figured that would be the best time to get over him, but we still have almost all of September before school starts. He and I both want to try to enjoy all the time we have left together, but is it really smart of us to kind of \"hold on\" for the month I'll be gone and then churn out the rest of our temporary relationship? \n\nI've been with him so long, and even now it feels weird and totally sucks that it's ending forever soon. But I still really love hanging out with him and probably wouldn't hang out with many people before college starts, anyways. \n\nI guess my request for advice is: what should my next course of action be? Should we break up and distance ourselves now, or should be try to hold on until summer ends? I know that breaking up will hurt me for quite some time so maybe I could use a month or two as a time cushion.\n\nReally hope this stuff makes sense and I appreciate this community. thanks","chosen":"Boyfriend and I are splitting up for college, I don't know if we should split before school starts so we can get over it or wait until summer ends","rejected":"boyfriend going away for college, I still have almost all of August to get over him before school starts, what should I do?"}

He also gets along quite well with my cat(he will sometimes bark and try to play with the cat -.-) but other than that they will lay right next to each other and go to sleep.

After waiting for almost an hour to be seen I managed to calm him and have him sit next to me on a bench. Once our name was called, however, the noise from inside scared him out again.(trying to go back out and having his tail down) The lady who takes my dog is clearly irritated at the type of breed I have. She talked to me as if I knew nothing about the breed and snapped angrily about how aggressive the breed was. After waiting for the nurse to return with my dog she proceeded to tell me about how my dog is EXTREMELY people aggressive and ill have a lawsuit on my hands if I don't fix it.

{"prompt":"My SO (21) and I (20) have been together for over a year and 6 months. The one thing that really interests me is how difficult he finds it to say I love you, to anyone really. He was bullied a lot as a kid and conditioned himself to stop feeling so the bullies couldn't hurt him.\n\n'Love' hasn't been an issue between us at all because I accept that it's hard for him to say it and when I say it myself, I don't expect him to say it in return.\n\nA year ago he did tell me he loved me and I was shocked but after a while he stopped saying it. I was worried that he stopped having feelings for me, so last night I asked him if he did love me because I've been confused about what his feelings are towards me. He shrugged and told me that he doesn't know what love is and doesn't know if he's feeling it. I then asked why he said it to me earlier in our relationship and he said that he thought that I wanted him to say it. I told him he was crazy for thinking that and that I didn't care if he couldn't say it. But he says he feels guilty that he can't say it because then he feels like everything is one sided (which it isn't).\n\nI thought about us today and realised that although he can't say it, he's shown it. During some off our worst fights (in cases where most guys would up and leave) he couldn't bare to leave me (even though he thought about it) and he was there for me when I was at my worst (he's always tolerant) he'll always want cuddles, be happy to drive me when I need him to (he hates driving), buy me flowers, pay for dinners, cook for me, the list goes on. A word to me doesn't matter because he treats me well. I'm not saying we are perfect, we're probably worse than must when we get into huge fights but will always stick around for the other.\n\nDoes anyone have a similar relationship?

{"prompt":"So I dated this really beautiful girl last fall for about a month or so, things didn't really work out due to timing and she moved back home to take care of her sick mother. Recently, about two months ago, we started chatting again and it got sexual...starting sexting and exchanging photos, with making plans for her to come up and visit me and have sex (we did not have sex when dating, though we did other things of that nature, just not intercourse). \n\nWell, I saw her briefly when she was in town a week ago for work and it really hit me that she is in a very vulnerable place right now due to her mom's situation. And that maybe having sex with her wouldn't be the best idea or would be taking advantage of her. I'm worried she may have reconnected and started this sexual stuff with me because she isn't doing well at the moment and this was a way of coping. It was clear to me when we met up that she is pretty vulnerable and not just the kind of person to have sex for the fun of it. The thing is, I may be moving in a few months, so if she does come back to the city we couldn't be together in a serious way and I don't want to sleep with her when she is vulnerable like this, then not be there for her in the long-term. I'd feel like a dick because she is the sweetest girl. I just feel bad for carrying this on for two months now and don't know how to deal with the situation. Do you think it would be wrong for me to sleep with her when she is like this? If so, how can I break that to her?

{"prompt":"I used to have bad social anxiety so interacting with anyone, male or female was difficult unless we were friends. I've mostly overcome that over the last few years to the point where I would consider myself relatively socially adept. I can spark conversations with strangers, no issues talking to pretty girls at a party etc.\n\nSo, with my new found social prowess I've finally been interacting with people and had some women who enjoyed my company. Great right? Except I respond by freaking out and basically rejecting\/friend-zoning them so they figure I'm not interested. It doesn't even seem like a conscious decision, by brain seems to just auto pilot to diffusing any potential romantic escalation despite how badly I actually want it.\n\nAfter a lot of reflection I believe it's both a self esteem and sex thing. I haven't had sex, despite a few opportunities over the years with people virtually offering. My refusals have been due to low self esteem - I'm overweight, nothing crazy but it's enough that I refuse to take off my shirt around other people because I'm ashamed. I'm also ashamed to have not had sex yet and I think the person will work it out which terrifies me.\n\nI'm working on the weight thing, 40lbs down, 40lbs till my goal weight. The sex thing is more of an issue. I was considering paying for it to reduce the anxiety of totally failing with a person I'm actually interested in but the idea doesn't thrill me. I also have a romantic idea that if I get buff enough the other party won't be so concerned that I don't appear to know what I'm doing but that's realistically another 18 months away.\n\nAny advice or related anecdotes would be much appreciated.","chosen":"I actively shut down anything that might turn physical because I'm terrified both of being outed as a virgin and the prospect of getting naked in front of somebody.","rejected":"Have overcome social anxiety and now think it's due to low self esteem and fear of rejection.

{"prompt":"Back story: My bf (26\/M) and I (25\/F) have been together off and on for almost two years now. The reason for the break was because I left to go teach for a year abroad and to kind of find myself. I'm back now and we got back together. \n\n**UPDATED BACKSTORY** - The break up wasn't me breaking up with him to go abroad. We had talked about me going, staying together for the process, and having him come over on a visa for the last two months to stay with me. Three months into my journey **HE** dumped **ME**. Not the other way around. This was a job opportunity trip that helped me in my field of profession. I didn't cheat on him nor did I talk\/sleep with someone after the break up. I focused on my job.\n\nLast night while out with my guy (26\/M) at a bar we ran into some of his old coworkers. After some chatting the coworkers realized that I was the girl who left the country. They proceed to tell my BF, in front of me, that he should dump me, asked him why he was with me, told him I was a bitch and that I'll probably leave again. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was when one of them stated \"Well, at least she lost some weight while she was gone.\" \n\nMy guy, though definitely uncomfortable with the situation, failed to say anything or stick up for me. I was left trying to change the conversation onto anything else that I could. They were drunk so I can look past the remarks but I can't seem to shake the fact that my guy didn't say anything to them to try and make them stop. He did apologize for their remarks afterwards but the damage was done. I'm not looking for him to fight my battles but I was very disappointed in how he handled the situation.

They both put me through a hell of a lot (he said she said shit), and last year my therapist even said, \"Your mother should have cut contact between you and him when you were ten, and left it at that.\"\n\nThis was after telling her that as a child he's made me pick up cigarette butts off of his yard \"as a game\", change my step-brother's diapers (I was a kid myself, maybe 8-9 or something?), and of course this huge dramatic event where he beat the shit out of me when I was 10 for not wanting to cut my hair. That event in particular led me to not speak to him for several years.\n\nMy therapist said it's up to me if i want to try to have a relationship with him (whom she agrees has huge issues), and I decided against it. He's religiously abusive, and can't seem to get past the fact that I'm atheist. He's got a big new family now, and I have lived with him a few times throughout the years (18-19, 21-23), but I just don't care to have a relationship with him.

That's later...\n\nSo -- I know my income and the fixed expenses (rent, insurance, etc.). What I struggle with when creating a budget is the variable costs such as my wife's income (she's full-time, but paid hourly and paychecks vary depending on holidays, sick time, etc.), gas\/electric (which changes pretty dramatically month-to-month), etc.\n\nWhat about factoring in things like doctors (co-pays, etc.), prescriptions, etc. that also happen every month. I also have some ESPP, 401K, credit card debt (for the first time ever, due to multiple unexpected things happening at once... long story, doesn't matter),  Student loans, etc. One problem is that I think the money is too \"spread out\" over multiple accounts.\n\nI'm thinking that one of the incomes could cover most of the expenses, and the other can cover leftover debt & savings, but would like to account for every dollar to make sure that is happening\/can happen.\n\nI'll need to make another post once I get all this sorted out, but where is the best place to start?

I have fallen in love with her but this is the first time I have been in a very committed relationship. I feel that there is no way for me to know if she is 'the one' within a year's time. \n\nThis is a hot button issue for us each time it comes up. She wants reciprocity for the emotions she is feeling but I know I can't give it to her. When I start to give wishy-washy answers (because it's still a big question mark in my head), she becomes upset. It's to a point where I placate her instead of being able to talk honestly. \n\nI find the whole issue frustrating because I am happy with the relationship but feel no need to rush those questions. For her, it's frustrating because she does not want to feel as if she is wasting time with me if marriage isn't possible. \n\nI feel like this is a classic problem many young couples encounter but I am seriously stuck on how to navigate these conversations without heated arguments.","chosen":"Girlfriend of 1 year pushes question of marriage but I am feeling pressured due to limited knowledge of her feelings towards future. Need advice on how to navigate these conversations without heated arguments.","rejected":"GF wants to be together for life and have kids. I am not ready for that yet.

{"prompt":"I was at a mall with 2 friends and i guy came up and began to start trouble, we got in to an argument that escalated to a fight. While i was charging at him he pulled out a revolver and shot me in the chest, that didn't phase me much so I kept going and he shot me again. We wrestled until he wasted the other 4 bullets he had left in his revolver. I realized since the gun was empty I had no other choice but to strangle him to death. It took me what felt like hours to get the job done i squeezed his neck so hard that it ended up looking like a shoe lace. He attempted to grasp some air so i tied his neck like in a knot and made sure I finally got the job done. Since I was shot i decided to go to the bathroom and clean up, on my way there I noticed my ex-gf that I treated poorly a year ago and regret to this day. I walk up to her with 2 bullet wounds and attempt to get her back by asking her out while she laughs and makes fun of me with her 2 friends. I leave while they laugh behind me and meet up with my 2 friends that are standing beside the guy that i killed and tell me I need to wait 2 days to get the bullets out since its the weekend, unless I want to tell my mother about it. I tell them that no way in hell am I telling my mother. I don't remember what happen after this because I think I woke up.","chosen":"guy gunned me down, fought for nearly 4 hours, strangled him to death, exgf and 2 friends laugh behind me, don't remember what happen after. what interesting dreams have you had recently?","rejected":"I kill a guy, he shoots me in the chest, I strangle him, he tries to get air, he overdoes it and I kill him."}
{"prompt":"Let me start off by saying that I know this isn't as important as other people's problems here but I need some advice on how to proceed on this situation.\n\nSo currently I have a crush on a girl from my school and things are actually going great. We're not there yet but we currently are really good friends and things seem to be moving towards better. A couple of months ago one of my friends keep telling me that he thinks my crush's friend is very pretty so I adviced him to write to either ask her out or start talking to her on facebook. He thought asking her out was a bit weird so they started talking and have been ever since. \n\nEver since they started talking, my crush told me that her friend has a little thing for my friend and I thought that was great. But a few days ago I overheard my friend saying that he just wants to have sex with her cause she is hot and then move on to the next girl. I of course told him to tell the girl now and not just use her emotions in his favor but he refuses so I said that if he doesn't and they ask me about his feelings I will tell them the truth. He got kind of mad and said that it's his business and that if I do that then he won't ever speak to me again. And of course any other guy in the class has sided with him saying that I don't know how to be a good friend.\n\nSo I just wanted to ask, do you think that I tell the girls the truth if they ever ask me about his intentions or should I lie for his sake as everyone else says?","chosen":"My friend wants to bang my crush's friend and plans to use her feelings to his advantage.

{"prompt":"It could have been for a good or bad reason, but we have all been stubborn at times. And sometimes it gets out of hand, maybe with parents or an SO, to the point where it's just stupid and you perhaps look like a complete asshole.\n\nMy most stubborn moment came at a celebration for a friend's birthday party in high school. We had a few people get together (I think about 8 or 10) and after just hanging around for a bit we all decide to catch a movie as a group. We hadn't decided which movie to see so we discussed it when we arrived. Since we were leaning towards comedy, it came down to two choices: Most people wanted to watch Shark Tale, but I was adamant about Shaun of the Dead. People caught in the middle sided with the birthday girl, who wanted to watch Shark Tale, which left me as the only one fighting for SotD. None of us had seen either movie before at the time, but I swore on my life that SotD would be better. It escalated and I made a ***huge*** fuss and had to be taken aside and calmed down before *very* reluctantly agreeing to side with the hive-mind. I was ready to start walking home or even wait outside while everyone else watched Shark Tale. We were each paying for our own tickets so paying for a movie I did not want to see and thought would be terrible definitely played a factor. After the movie people started to latch on to the idea that I may have been correct in my assertion, and I basically sulked and kept my mouth shut for the rest of the night. Needless to say after everyone saw SotD on their own time I was more or less vindicated for my actions. Despite my stubborn outburst I didn't lose any friends, including the birthday girl, who is actually one of my best friends to this day and is also a fellow redditor. We have laughed about this since, despite me carrying some major guilt for acting the way I did.","chosen":"My most stubborn moment was when I was a teenager and I was adamant about a movie I wanted to see. I was the only one fighting for it and I ended up being right.","rejected":"Group of friends wanted to see Shark Tale over Shaun of Dead, I fought stubbornly for SotD and made a complete ass of myself in the meantime."}
{"prompt":"A bit of background on myself: I am a photographer by trade.  Somewhat as a joke, my girlfriend has always playfully been very against my taking photos of her.  It hurt and annoyed me at first when she played coy, but eventually I just stopped trying to involve her in my work.   \n\nShe is a very attractive girl - to the point of being openly approached constantly whenever she's out at no matter the setting (work, etc).  That said, she grew into her good looks and somewhat enjoys the attention she gets now.  Recently, she was asked to model for a clothing company startup she is a fan of.  Excited with the idea, she agreed.\n\nAt the moment, I am a mixture of supportive, jealous, insecure, and unsure.  The photographer inside me is against the idea because it's unpaid and I feel they're taking advantage of her.  The boy in me is jealous that she is so enamored with the idea and was so resistive to me (taking photos) initially.  I'm also just not that comfortable with my girlfriend choosing to be ogled by people online - perhaps a bit possessive\/insecure, but I just don't love the idea of her half naked all over the internet and lastly... The boyfriend in me is being supportive and pushing her to do something she wants to even though I really feel bad about it.  \n\nI don't want to push her away and I want to see her happy.  How do I deal with my own insecurities and jealousy with this situation.  She's at the shoot right now and having a great time.

{"prompt":"Long time lurker, made an account to tell this and hopefully stop stressing so much. So I'm a junior in High school, and a clumsy one at that. Yesterday during marching drill before actual practice began, me and some friends were all sitting outside in the small parking lot we have for band and sports personnel. The lot had been empty up until a few minutes before \"the event\" happened. I never noticed a car had come in, and was talking with a friend. Keeping eye contact and walking backwards at a moderate pace as she followed. Last second she yells \"PintoBean, STOP!\" and I quickly stop, stumble over my foot and fall straight back... into a car. I somehow made a 2 1\/2ft wide 1ft tall 1\/2in thick dent in the back door of this car (I'm about 5' 10\" and 145lbs). I limp my way inside to get the owner of the car, and he seems fine with it and just wants me to cover insurance\/ damages if needed, perfect, no issues, just a small mishap. This was reported to the office as an incident and I'm called in the next morning (day I'm posting) and he's in there, they contact my parents, clear things up, and I give the car owner my parents info to talk about insurance and what to do, the school at this point was just a medium for us to work this out through. So later that day I'm called into the office for the school police officer along with the friend I was talking to. We walk in with the principle I talked with in the morning. We are seated, the officer explains everything, tells us to be calm and we can work this out, average stuff. About near the end of him clearing things up, he breaks part of the news (couldn't tell us everything without the presence of a parent\/ guardian) that the owners mom is choosing to go through Juvenile Services and charge me as a criminal instead of just working out insurance. I await tomorrow in which everything will be worked out and my future behold. I'll update if you guys want or not","chosen":"tried to keep eye contact with friend during practice, huge accident resulted from my sloppy attempt at being polite and nothing was done.

{"prompt":"Recently my girlfriend and I broke up. In the months leading up to our break up I was very stress and did not handle it well. This led me to treat her terribly. We both had a lot going on but she was able to curtail her outbursts at me, I failed to.

I finally was weak and had to tell her how I felt, how much she means to me and how much regret I feel.. Promised her I've identified and am working on what brought me down and promised will never treat her like that again.\n\nThis only made her more frustrated with me. She said she never will get back together with me and that she will never be with anyone who treats her like I did.\n\nI've been in longer relationships in my life but none of them felt the way this one did nor have I ever fall this hard for the person she genuinely is. For the majority of our relationship I treated her like a princess, up until other things came up and I got overwhelm.\n\nShe very raw right now, extremely mad at me, says she's done with me.

{"prompt":"Okay so I broke up with my girlfriend a week ago. We were living together. The brake up was mutual since we both expected it. We both had our small fights but that was expected. Until yesterday where she went out with some people from her work place. After she returned her makeup was kinda ruined after hours of dancing and drinking. So I told her that she looked like a prostitute after her shift ended.\n\nShe didn't say anything and went straight to sleep. Next day she didn't even say a good morning to me. I got up, got dressed and went out with a friend. After I returned home she just bombed me with every problem in our relationship.

There are something like 10 adults in the house and there's a car for each of them most of the time.\nParking on the grass is obviously against county code, but a complaint gets a code guy out in oh, say....two months and usually in the middle of the day when they're all at work so whoever is home just pleads innocence and that's the end of that.  \n\n-Apparently, they have some kind of law that each SUV shall be equipped with a sound system capable of producing bass reaching into the infrasonic spectrum.

I said I wasn't quite sure why she told me about it and she said it was because she was covered in bruises which made my stomach sink.

Of course I didn't say that. It just kind of sucks to hear this. So I asked what she wanted with me and she said she wants to progress into a relationship eventually.

I am always the one who initiates and he often will huff and act like it's a chore but give in to make me happy. Last night it had been 2 weeks and we were finally about to be intimate again but he wasn't able to stay aroused. I was mortified but tried not to make a big deal about it because I didn't want him to be embarrassed either. At this point I'm really starting to think that he's just not sexually attracted to me. He's a British expat (I live in Texas) and doesn't know many people here so I'm thinking more and more that he's with me just so that he's not alone on the weekend and that he may not have sexual or romantic feelings about me at all. I can feel myself becoming more self conscious and withdrawing from him but I don't know how to stop it. If I try to speak to him about it he just rolls his eyes and tells me that I'm over analyzing everything. \n\nI know enough about men to logically understand that this may not be about me at all but might be about stress or something else that he's dealing with on his own but I can't help that every time he rejects me it feels like a slap in the face.

{"prompt":"Hey. Throwaway here...  \n\nI have a heartache. I'm in a LDR with my boyfriend of almost 2 years. I will be visiting him soon. The distance is hard, but we try to be pretty consistent about Skyping and visiting. It's less than 2 hours away by plane, so it could be a lot worse. We've been friends for five years, and he's been great. I sometimes contrive loneliness due to lack of attention, but we're both busy with full schedules. I never felt the head-over-heels attraction for him, but fell in love with him pretty gradually. He was there for me after a bad break up and eventually feelings developed. We've been together since, and for the most part I've been pretty happy.\n\nI met someone recently, and I began to realize that I was quickly developing a crush. We would message each other throughout the day when I was at work, just to talk, and I now know I look forward to it. It doesn't hurt that this guy seems to be reciprocating. I realize that having a crush isn't the end of the world and can happen to anyone, and I don't feel any desire to cheat, but I'm at such a loss on how to deal with my emotions. I haven't done anything save for talk to this guy, and I feel immense guilt because I know I'm enjoying it. I'm trying to muster up the willpower to just cut the connection before it gets harder for me, and then another part of me tells me not to. \n\nI'm not 100% sure what I'm asking, but I felt like I had no outlet and needed to get this off of my chest.

{"prompt":"This is a serious question, not a troll.  I've completed a stage of therapy, and my lesbian therapist has informed me I am not really lesbian or even that strongly bisexual, but instead I am emotionally unavailable.  She says I kept attracting gay and bisexual men because it was a way of telling and proving to myself I was open to dating men while also remaining safe.  She also said I tend to see relationships and men in very dire, pessimistic terms (she's correct), and am not yet open to seeing them positively.\n\nTherapist wants to begin the next stage with me and calls it healing my emotional unavailability.  \n\nI'm pretty scared and feel like it's worthless to even try.  Yep, I was completely over attracting gay guy after gay guy after mind game player after misogynist over psycho after headcase, but I feel \"healing\" this unavailability will just make me open to even worse exploitation.  So far I've experienced heterosexual men as brute, primitive, stupid, sex-obsessed oafs who prefer throwing a sports ball to interacting with women and see us only as dolls and toys -- or obsessive stalky maniacs who want to suffocate, smother and use women.  I know this is not healthy and not true.\n\nIf it's in you, Reddit, please in a serious, hopefully somewhat compassionate way list some ways heterosexual men are of value to heterosexual women.  I'll use these lists to work on my intellectual resistance to healing.  Right now I don't see any connection between women and men at all, I see no value whatsoever to men except as business partners and buddies, and I see marriage and other types of heterosexual relationships as women-exploitative.\n\n(And yeah, I know you'll see the opposite as just as horrible, but please skip those kinds of answers right now.

We started dating in the middle of February, and so far as I can tell from what he's told me and the interactions we've had, I don't think he's grieved much since that time, unfortunately we are also long distance most of the time because I'm attending college in a neighboring state.

{"prompt":"I never believed in divorce, I thought marriage was forever but life dealt me another set of cards. We went down every avenue trying to fix our marriage - two inpatient rehab stays, AA, Al-Anon, marriage counseling, individual counseling.

I moved to another state and moved in with my parents and the three of us work together to care for my son and make his life as happy as possible. My dad is super involved, changing diapers, taking him for walks, playing with him, etc but my dad is not his father. \n\nI'm struggling even though I know my decision was the right one with the guilt of robbing my son of his real father.

We never really hang out or anything, but we always greeted each other and talked for a bit if we saw each other anywhere.\n\nI got the number, even though it seemed like she wasn't too interested when she gave me it. She made an excuse when i called her to meet up, so i just figured she's not interested, but i can't just forget her, i'm in deep, even hearing her voice when i called her is like a drug to me. \n\nShe studies in a city about an hour away at the moment, which i will be going to with my friend. It's not because of her, we're going just to go out and party there, it's the capital here.\n\nWhich brings me up to my question.\nDo you guys\/girls think there is still a chance?

{"prompt":"So we've been good friends for almost 9 months and talk A LOT. Mostly online, but we hang out in person when we get the chance and we chatted on the phone a bit over the summer. However, sometimes stuff he has said has made me wonder if he actually likes me, or he's gotten more comfortable with the fact we're friends and isn't afraid of me misunderstanding. And before you ask, yes, we have actually talked about what happened if unreciprocated crushing\/love were to occur, and we basically agreed that we can't really predict what may or may not have in the future. However, neither of us want to lose the other's friendship, so if this situation were to occur, I assume no one would confess.\n\nBut now I think this may actually be happening. If it is, what do I do? Do I pull away and give him space so he can get over me (because I do not foresee myself anytime wanting to be with him)? Do I confront him? I really think I'm just going to ignore it and let him do what he wants. If he doesn't want to confess and just go on as everything's normal, then I will too.

She is sort of touchy with him and Gwen is her first lesbian relationship. But we only see them less than once a year since we live very far away from each other now. \n\nNow here's the problem. Apparently, before he met me, Gwen and he would talk about how he would donate sperm if she ever wanted to have a baby with her partner. So I guess she and Kelly want to have a baby and have brought up this idea of using my husbands sperm. He says it's an honor that they would deem his DNA as good enough for their child. The problem is I am totally against it. I don't want my husband to have another child (we have one, and one more on the way) with another woman.

{"prompt":"Hey Reddit, since you guys were pretty helpful last time I asked for relationship advice I'm hoping that can be the case this time too. So I've been dating my current girlfriend since this past August and things have been great. I've actually known her for 3 years but when we tried dating when I was 17 and she was 20, her mom was having none of that so obviously things didn't last very long. So, 3 years later and we're trying again, this time with her mother's approval and her father's approval, or so we thought. Last night my girlfriend's dad gave her a long winded conversation of basically why he doesn't like me, how apparently he thinks I'm not going anywhere in life (to be fair I'm only a student in my 2nd year of Architecture technology, not sure where he got that idea from), he also said I don't talk to him enough when he's never really tried to make conversation with me and says I don't look him in the eye which I have, not sure where that's coming from either, point is he doesn't like me. She mostly thinks it has to due with him being raised by an abusive father, for he kept saying to her well I would never bring a girl to my house when I was your age, which my girlfriend said to me she wouldn't have either if she lived in that house. On a side, my girlfriend has cerebrallypalsy affecting the right side of her brain but its an extremely mild case. The only things she can't really do is drive and cut her own food and other two handed tasks that most people take for granted. So I guess because of this her parents are a little bit more protective. But last night my girlfriend's Father also compared her to her older brother and older sister, saying he never had to deal with any of this from them, (neither of them have any disabilities) so my girlfriend got pretty upset and doesn't know what to do.

I have a few close friends who I rarely see, I'm in a band, and I can feel that old confidence coming back, but it's coming back very slowly. I would appreciate any advice on speeding up the 'recharging process' and also on meeting new people.","chosen":"Born an extrovert. Bullied into being an introvert. Shit sucked, but I got over it.

{"prompt":"Hey reddit, obvious throwaway just to be safe. This is an odd situation with me.\n\nEarlier today I was at work having lunch, when Kate decides to tell me and another co-worker a secret of hers. It went something like \"2 years ago, Adam that used to work here engaged in sexual activies\" - she knew I was friends with Adam, she did not know that he lives with me however. \n\nNow, normally I would confront him about it, ask him wtf he is doing, he's my best mate - but he tends to not always think with his head. The problem lies with the fact his girlfriend is also a very good friend of mine, and so if I confront the issue between them, im walking away without a friend. \n\nI know he's better than this, but I am extremely upset. Furthermore, if it was something that happened 2 years ago, I would accept he fucked up and moved on, but Kate decides to tell me that he contacted her this spring. Which means, once a cheater always a cheater. His excuse for it was pathetic, Kate knew she fucked up and declined any more efforts of his.\n\nSo reddit, what should I do? Part of me is inclined to erase this from my memory, it's none of my business, it's between Adam, Kate, and Adam's GF. On the other hand, Adam's gf is crazy about him, wants to marry him, and seeing her waste her life away on this guy is heartbreaking. If I told her, I am scared of what he might to do - he lives with me and it will get ugly, as he has anger issues  (albeit, not as bad as they used to be) and tends to act on impulse rather than with his head.

He told me he couldn't handle being so far apart from me anymore and it was causing him a lot of stress. I felt the same way too; I had a lot of anxiety, and so we decided to stay as friends. We still talked regularly as if nothing had changed, except that we cut the \"I love you's\" and pet names. But 2 weeks ago I found out that he has a new girlfriend. I was more upset about the fact that he didn't tell me about it. I suppose because we were friends now we could talk about anything, especially about something as major as that. He said he was afraid to \"lose\" me if he'd told me.\n\nHe still talks to me regularly. I try to avoid him when I can now. I thought he'd rather focus on his new relationship, and so I started talking to a guy on Tinder. We'd meet regularly, mainly for sex. At some point I just forgot to check my phone so I was avoiding calls and texts from my ex. He then asked me if he'd done something wrong because he felt that I was avoiding him. \n\nWhen I told him I was seeing someone, he became really upset\/jealous and even said that I deserve better than a guy who just wants to fuck me. We talked for 3 hours about this, and he admitted that he still has feelings for me, that he really loves me but the distance is holding us back. He said his girlfriend is great but not as \"amazing\" as me.  He missed the connection we had. I feel the same way. And now I think we're equally confused.

Couldn't say anything, didn't know what to say or do. \n\nInstantly he said that he didn't know how that got there and was really confused. He genuinely looked really upset and confused by the situation. I said maybe he accidentally saved it from some website or w\/e. He said that he didn't know and couldn't remember watching or looking at porn of said image. I pretty much shut down and just couldn't say anything else for a while.

{"prompt":"Okay, So today I was just thinking about my relationship with my boyfriend. I'm his first girlfriend (He's 28 and I'm 19, big age gap I know but we've never seen a problem with it, we both are mature and live on our own, etc) and from what he's told me he's just never known how to talk to girls. His friends have confirmed this. We've been dating for 4 months and he lives 5 minutes from me so we literally see each other almost every day. In the beginning, he always told me how amazing I was and how he was crazy about me. Now, I'm the only one who ever says those kinda of things. I know it isn't a big problem, because he shows he's caring in physical ways by making sure I'm taken care of, cuddling, etc. I stay the night at his place often and whenever I ask, he always says he wants me to stay. We have a great time together, and I always let him know that if he feels like we shouldn't hang out as much, then that's fine. He always seems to want to have me over and to spend time. Sex is great, I just feel like maybe our sexual relationship as developed further than our emotional one. So there's that. I'm sort of a shy person, but not when it comes to my feelings, I really do care for him and am head over heels for him. I let him know that, but for some reason, I expect at this point in our relationship feelings should be talked about more than I just telling him the occassional \"you mean the world to me\" or \"I'm crazy about you\" and him reciprocating it.

{"prompt":"Over two years ago my girlfriend and I started dating in secret. We were in secret because my parents are (racist?) in the way that they only want me to date people from an Asian background like me, and she is white. Eventually, because our school is super small and rumors spread like crazy, the staff found out maybe about a year ago. We went and made sure they knew not to go to our parents, and they all agreed. Fast forward to now and the principal and guidance counselor have called my parents and spilled the entire story to them. They apparently even had to use generic words like \"girlfriend and her mom\" instead of saying names to get around privacy rules. After talking it over with some of our close friends, no one has any insight or heard of anything that could cause them to do this, and it's very uncharacteristic of them. My parents have told me that the school administration has said things such as, \"She's in a lower social class, he can do better,\" \"She's bringing his grades down\" (I have a 4.0 GPA), etc. While my parents have also said things such as \"She's white trash,\" and \"She's a gold digger,\" I know for sure that those are both incorrect. Heck, my parents haven't even spoken to her for more than 3 minutes. Now that the jig is up, I'm not sure what to do. Do I secretly talk to her and risk losing everything except food and school supplies for the next year if I get caught? Do I  make arrangements to get back together in a year?

{"prompt":"So I just came back from studying abroad and have been staying at my parents house until I move into my college apartment on Monday. The house is in a quiet town, kind of suburb-ish. The backyard ends with woods and hiking trails. \n\nAnyways, my 80 year old aunt said she had a litter of kittens living underneath her porch. The only human contact they had was her feeding them in the morning, which she couldn't afford to do for much longer. My sister and I went on July 14 and spent an hour luring one into a cat carrier. We surprised our mom and she was not too happy at first. Neither our mom, nor the kitten, would talk to us for 2 days haha. We discussed that the kitten was mine. I would be taking care of him and he'd be coming with me to my new apartment. Things got much better after 3 days. We discovered he was a boy kitty and I named him Caesar (I studied in Rome). He quickly became very sociable with humans and you could never tell he was ever feral. \n\nMy mom has had two male yellow Labradors since 2003 and a female cat since 2005. Caesar was scared of the dogs at first but now they love each other. The cat is another story. Caesar is a tiny energetic fur ball and always wants to play. He charges straight at her and she's just not about that life. They've never physically fought but she does hiss when he's nearby. For 10 years she always liked to go outside during the daytime to hunt smaller animals and chill with the dogs. I let her out yesterday morning and she hasn't been back since.

Just the other day she waited for me to get home from work so I could help her do the laundry.\n\nShe doesn't physically take care of herself. She eats like crap. She has gained 30lbs in two years. I have to ask her to shave her legs and armpits. \n\nThe last thing is that I am having an extremely hard time staying sober with her. I'm an addict; coke, weed, alcohol. I worked extremely hard to get my life together. She does not do drugs and drinks socially. All her friends are heavily into drinking and also into coke. They are always trying to buy me drinks and taking about drugs. I slipped up last week and did coke for a few days. This isn't what I want for my life!\n\nIt's not working.\nThe problem is that she is completely dependant on me. She could never afford rent on her own and this would basically force her to move back in with her parents.\nI feel like such crap. I pursued her hard. I asked her to move in with me and I asked her to marry me. I believe this will be completely blind side her.\nI know I made her sound bad in this but I really do love her, I just can't be with her.\n\nWhat should I tell her?

{"prompt":"So we've been good friends for almost 9 months and talk A LOT. Mostly online, but we hang out in person when we get the chance and we chatted on the phone a bit over the summer. However, sometimes stuff he has said has made me wonder if he actually likes me, or he's gotten more comfortable with the fact we're friends and isn't afraid of me misunderstanding. And before you ask, yes, we have actually talked about what happened if unreciprocated crushing\/love were to occur, and we basically agreed that we can't really predict what may or may not have in the future. However, neither of us want to lose the other's friendship, so if this situation were to occur, I assume no one would confess.\n\nBut now I think this may actually be happening. If it is, what do I do? Do I pull away and give him space so he can get over me (because I do not foresee myself anytime wanting to be with him)? Do I confront him? I really think I'm just going to ignore it and let him do what he wants. If he doesn't want to confess and just go on as everything's normal, then I will too. I don't want to screw up our friendship, and he's strong enough to handle this, I think.

The usual daily routine is breakfast > uni > dinner > he'll sit on his computer all night! I'll be sat alone looking for something to do > bed.\n\nI've tried explaining how I feel to him, but he always sees it as me starting an argument.

I'd make mountains out of molehills, volcanoes out of mountains, and could find any reason in my head to think that she was deceiving me.

However, I noticed that almost immediately (within like 2 weeks) after we broke up this guy she met from a club started hitting on her. She claims to have no attraction towards him but anyone with a pair of eyes can see there's a mutual attraction. Now I don't like this guy because he was hitting on her while we were still dating. I just got onto Facebook today to see her and a picture of him together celebrating his 21st birthday.\n\nI know I'm the one that broke it off and it's my fault for doing so, but I can't help but feel...betrayed?

{"prompt":"So, this all started a few months back when I first moved into my new place. I was low on groceries from moving and bought a ton of food to last me a couple of weeks. I figured I might as well by some potatoes because they're easy to make even though I rarely ate them growing up. After a few weeks, I was settled in but had yet to eat the potatoes that were sitting on the bottom of the shelf I put all my food on. They had started budding a bit and I decided that I should let them bud a bit more since I had never seen them grow more than the few little spots\/eyes. So, after another month, they had budded a lot more to a point where they were piercing through the packaging. I thought this looked pretty cool and once again decided to keep them there to see how far they could go before I got bored of them, or when they started taking up too much space. Now, after a couple more months, I stopped checking on them and pretty much forgot they were even there. This was only until recently when I was throwing out any old food left on my shelves... Before this, there were a lot of bugs (I'm told fruit flies) in my house, but I guessed they were coming through my window from the creek nearby... However, when I was throwing out the old food, I noticed the potatoes had grown massively, and I could see they were falling apart when I picked them up. That's when I realized where the insects were coming from. Inside the packaging were dozens and dozens of larvae eating the potatoes. I immediately dropped the package in disgust and had chills running through my body. I picked it up after a few seconds of shouting \"HOLY SHIT\" over and over, and threw it away in the dumpster outside immediately...

She jumped on the kitchen counter and peed on my nephew's baby bottles. She peed on all the towels my parents use and in their shower. She peed in all of our showers. ***That's not the worst part!*** My sister didn't realize the cat peed on her shirts (it had dried by then) and wore one of them to work. And my mother didn't know the cat peed on the towel she had used to dry herself after taking a shower - that was until she saw the kitchen and figured out the strange smell of her towel was, in fact, pee. Everyone in the house wants that cat put down.\n\nI would be the one to have to put her down and I don't want to do it. My cat is mean, she is annoying, and has ruined every couch and dining room chair we have had. Yet I don't want to put her down because in the past two months I've had four of my dogs pass away (from old age) and another one is on the way. \n\nI set up a cat litter box for now but what else can I do? Should I have her checked by the vet? (it's about $160..and $400 if they run blood tests) I've never had to euthanize a pet before but it seems so..wrong I guess to do it because of a peeing situation.","chosen":"My cat peed in all the places she shouldn't and now she's a nightmare.

{"prompt":"I've recently started a relationship (I'm 22M she's 22F), and now that it's starting to get pretty serious I've started to have the problem that has helped end other relationships for me: that I'm being a little overly-jealous.\n\nWe spend the night apart for the first time in a couple weeks because her friend (another girl) was in town and stayed with my SO for the night.  I was of course totally cool with this, as it gave me a chance to play some discgolf with my buddy.  She even let me keep her car for the night (I've been driving it to work\/school rather then driving the bus).  We planned that she would come over in the morning and hang out for a bit.\n\nSo this morning I woke up to her kissing me, everythings cool, but then she said she had to take her car and leave right away.  I was still half asleep but right after she left I was like wtf?  It really pissed me off, and I sent her a pretty harsh message over facebook (my phones currently dead).  Turns out she was going to breakfast with her friend, and they've been hanging out all day.  I feel really jealous that she gave up on our plans to hang out with her friend instead.  But I think I'm taking it too hard, because we're together every night and she should be able to hang out with her friend for a couple days.\n\nThis has happened in previous relationships, when plans change and my SO hangs out with other friends.","chosen":"Starting a serious relationship, started to get jealous when gf planned to hangout with friend instead, sent a pretty harsh message over facebook.

{"prompt":"A bit of back story.  I have been using this company to register my domain and host my site for years.  Its a little site, nothing special, just my home business.  I am really attached to my domain name, so when I returned to school I kept up payments but didn't keep much of a website (just the basic info on some pages, more brags than business)\n\nThe company billed me for the hosting automatically.  That reminded me I should update a couple of pages.  It was gone, and it was parked!  I did a whois and found they bought it less than a month after I paid last year for two years.  I did update a couple of pages after I paid last year so it was working for a bit.  \n\nI contacted the company and they were snarky.  They said that the CC payment hadn't gone through on the 24th of may.. which was true, for some reason the CC company thought using the CC online was suspicious, due to the fact it had never been used for that before.  It was cleared up and worked the next day.  I pointed out to them that the second payment had gone through.  Got a snarky reply that I had no idea what I was talking about and I must not have got the \"it didn't work email\"\n\nSo the CC was contacted and provided a statement for that month, which clearly shows the payment went through and was charged to the account.  Armed with this knowledge I emailed them back saying I had the statement, and would a scan do or did they need it mailed to them.\n\nThat was 2 weeks ago.  What should I (can I) do?

I have had girlfriends and we have gone on dates, but never have really had a first date experience, most of the time they were friends and it developed from there.

He's been late giving me rent for the last two months, and he still owes me one hundred from last month. When I tried to explain that I was worried he didn't respect how important rent is, he quickly got upset, and stormed off into the night to find an ATM. Over the phone, i've begged him to come home- it's about 2am here- but he maintains that I just want his money, and \"everything is about money\" to me. For the record, it's not, I would pay all of the rent if he told me ahead of time he couldn't afford it. I'm worried about him walking for miles in a strange city so late. \n\n His ego has been wrecked lately, because of lack of work and unhappiness with his appearance.

{"prompt":"Hey all, thought I would share as I needed to speak to someone about this. \n\nMy gf (F18) rung me today and said she had 'hooked up' with someone at a party two weeks ago. As I later find out it was a party that I was invited to but I declined due to exams week. I originally laughed it off and tell her not to worry, thinking it was literally just making out. Text her again, turns out is was full blown drunken sex of which 5 friends knew about before, during and after, of which none told me. The guy, lets call him 'Peter' supposedly had no idea I existed, which is feasible considering him and my gf were 'supposedly' drunk and high.\n\n It is only once she tells me about this that my male friends (that knew) decided to start supporting me of which they did, and only hesitated in telling me 2 weeks later due to the situation most likely effecting my performance in exams. My gf starts texting me with copious amounts of text messages saying that she had f***ed up, etc, etc. and that she hopes I can forgive her. \n\nWhat concerns me is that this was 1 occasion that I am aware of, and that I cant attend every party\/event\/gathering that she goes to, which makes me worried thinking that this incident may occur again due to her liking to drink and smoke (as most of everyone I know).

{"prompt":"My boyfriend's birthday is December 24th, which is Christmas Eve. He grew up in a foster home and never got great presents for either his birthday or Christmas. He often spends his birthday and Christmas alone because his foster mother is uninterested and he doesn't have a great relationship with his birth mother. \n\nHe spent Christmas with me last year, so I went out of my way to get him both a birthday present AND a Christmas present, both of which valued above $50. However, he was so thrilled to have someone to spend his birthday and Christmas with, he showered me with 5 very nice, expensive gifts. I felt terrible. Happy, but terrible.\n\nHe is a video game artist but was recently laid off from his job. He is very passionate about his video game collection. There is one game I noticed in his collection that he only has the sequel of. I asked him why because it is very unlike him. He said it was because the original was wildly expensive and he already had a hard time affording a mint condition version of the sequel.\n\nThe cheapest, mint condition version of the game I could find is about $500. I do not make a whole ton of money, but I have saved up enough for it but now I find myself having second thoughts.

We haven't been together all that long (about 6 months) and I don't know if it would be right to drop $500 on a present just yet.\n\nI have so many questions. Is this too much? Would it be creepy to get him something that he never asked for? What if giving him a game gives him bad feelings about getting laid off?

{"prompt":"I had a second interview with this company and I'm just baffled by the manager that interviewed me. With a good guess I'd say he was about 26, and I'm newly 20. Anyways, I was put together very professional-no cleavage was out or heavy makeup. While interviewing me, almost every time he asked me a question he would look down below my face while I was speaking to him. I always look people in the eye so he had to have known I could see what he was doing. But he kept doing it! And when he looked away from me, I would quickly put my hand to my chest to see if anything was there. Nothing. No cleavage, or crumbs, or something weird worthy of staring at. He was so calm and nonchalant about it too. I'm mostly used to this as I developed early and awkwardly in middle school, but when I would catch guys looking it was always instant red face for them. And the quick glance to anywhere but my chest like it never happened. Overall the interview went really well and we connected on growing up in small towns in crappy states and such, and he was very nice to me. I just don't get why some guys (this guy in particular), have no shame or embarrassment doing that. I don't think I would be able to stare at a guys package while knowing he's looking right at me. Especially in a more professional setting.","chosen":"I was uncomfortable by the manager looking down at me while he was interviewing me. He was calm and nonchalant about it.

{"prompt":"Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 7 months now, and it has been a blast since the very first day. We basically went from rather good friends to an amazing couple without any awkwardness or friendzone-y (?) problems. Because of this, we are both pretty much convinced that we have found \"the one\".\n\nHowever, I recently learned that she is rather envious of my past girlfriends, my last ex in particular. As far as I can tell, her main concern is that I have been intimate in the same ways with them as I have been with her. She can't quite seem to grasp the idea that with her, everything is very much different. Sexual acts are much more meaningful, if that makes any sense, than they were before. \n\nAdditionally, she has a hard time processing the idea that I, at some point, loved and cared for them too in the same way as I care for her now. I tend to be a little \"overly-attached\" at times, so I can't really object to this statement. It is not entirely impossible that I care for her the way I do simply because it's in my nature.\n\nHowever, I am positive that I have never been in love with anyone as I have been with my current girlfriend, and wouldn't want it all to end because of this. I have consoled her the best I could, but I'd rather keep it from you redditors.

So I decided to listen to the soundtrack by searching first for the Clock Town theme.\n\nI have a crappy phone, so the touchscreen isn't very accurate most of the time.

Which in return she said yes. Things are going great so far as a long distance relationship.\n\nThere are two major problems though. The first is that I'm currently in Germany on a tour for another 4 months. So the next time I'll be able to see her and actually take her on the date will be when I come home for PCS leave(In the army). We talk every day Via Phone and Skype etc, which is nice even though I've known her for 7 years this is really the first time I have been able to see her personality for what it is, and it is amazing. She really is Liking the LDR, because she says the last couple of boy friends she has been with sex has been really involved and obscured what she has really wanted. She says she brags about me all the time about how I'm Sweet and charming and thing of the like. What are your problems, success stories to help motivate me in that way. \n\nThe second thing is as much as I like her, she has HSV-1. With the amount of research I've done on this topic I'm skeptical about it. I am clean. I just don't know what to do. I like her...way to much for my own good, just to drop it off because of cold sores down below. As i mentioned above do you guys have any success stories, problems with a situation like this?

{"prompt":"I've had a rough year last year. I was getting over my big ex and now I found myself with someone else. Luckily this was a huge step in letting go of the past. I finally stopped thinking about anyone else other than my current girlfriend. However she forgot my birthday. I became upset and told her I was not ok with her just leaving me alone like that. She claimed she was tired and didn't want to do anything with me that day. I didn't speak to her for a few days I was so upset she completely ignored me. I confronted her about it. She said she doesn't want to fight and said this relationship is no longer what she wants. I was angry. \nI don't like it when someone to constantly say \"i love you\" then the next day throw you away like trash. I felt like trash. So for a while I didn't talk to her but we ended up hanging out together as friends. While we were friends we went on dates kissed and even had sex. I thought she was really into me again. Last night I asked her to be my girlfriend she said no. Then I asked her to leave. Her reason was that she loved me but not as much as she used to. Before she left she said she wanted to continue going on dates but would like more time to think about things. A mutual friend asked her if she would date me again and she said yes however she wasn't ready for a relationship yet. I'm not sure if I should continue seeing her.

{"prompt":"Relationship time: 5 months\n\nHey \/relationships,\n\nSo I met this girl at OSU earlier this year, and we both fell deeply in love.  This was my first real relationship, and I was smitten completely - I fell hard for her, and she did the same for me.  Now, at around 7 days, she said I love you, and I returned it, for I really thought that I felt that way.  Around 2 months in, we were talking about marriage and getting engaged, and formulating plans together for the future.  \n\nNow here is the issue.  I no longer am sure about getting engaged or married.  I definitely still want to be with her, but I am finally coming to my senses and realizing that 6 months is way, way, Way too soon to get engaged, and that I want to know her for a few years before I am comfortable with being married.  We're just beginning to get to know each other and commit to each other for life right now would just be laying the grounds for a potentially unhappy and unsuccessful marriage.\n\nWith all of that being said, I know the general consensus will just be to talk about it, and keep both parties on the same page regarding the relationship, and this is what I would do, if I knew that she wouldn't freak out completely.  She has deep abandonment issues and trust issues which we have been working through together, and I know she would view this as a violation of her trust and love.

{"prompt":"I don't know how to ask this without it sounding really silly, but this is a genuine problem. I created a throwaway because of too much personal detail in my main account. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are both grad students and have been together for four months now. I absolutely love him. He's sweet, caring, tolerant, liberal, basically every single thing on my 'checklist', if I had one, is there. \n\nThe problem, though, is he talks VERY slowly. I mean his speed is really slow. If I ask him anything, he takes about 3 seconds before he starts to talk, then when he starts, the words go at a very slow pace,and he even pauses for 3-5 seconds in the middle of his sentence. I get really impatient and sometimes just feel like telling him to hurry up (of course I don't, but I really feel like doing so). \n\nI asked him today, very gently, why he spoke so slow, and he said he just gets thoughts very slowly in his brain. He then went on to say he's just generally slow at thinking. I felt really sad when he said this, I don't know why. He's a Math PhD student,and we are at a pretty good school, and his research has been going slow for a while now (but this is totally normal in grad school), so I think that response was kind of a self-deprecating one since he's already low on self-esteem. \n\nAnyway, my point is, his speed of talking is just a part of him, it can't be changed. I love him so much otherwise but I just want to know how to deal with this. Conversation is so important in a relationship! How do we manage?

Yesterday during marching drill before actual practice began, me and some friends were all sitting outside in the small parking lot we have for band and sports personnel. The lot had been empty up until a few minutes before \"the event\" happened. I never noticed a car had come in, and was talking with a friend.

That said, I want some sense of security. \n\nShould I instead just man up and let it play out on its own (i.e. enjoy the relationship for what it is and wait for a natural progression), or is asking her to make it official a natural move in and of itself?\n\nLastly, what signs from her should I look for that she wants to make it official? She's already said things like \"I love sleeping with you; I love holding and being held by you; You're amazing; We're virtually in a relationship (but not quite); I really really like you\" etc. but she has also said things like \"This is moving kind of fast; You're going to get bored of me; We see each other so much\"","chosen":"Two months in, I really like this girl. Girl seems wary of commitment but really likes me. We're practically in a relationship but without the label.

{"prompt":"Rant follows:\n\nSo my fiancee and I have been in an amazing, intense relationship. We both like to drink and have a good time. That was one of the first things we noticed about each other - in past relationships we both felt like we had to try to act mature and stop partying, but together we just had so much fun hanging out together and going out with each others' friends, etc. \n\nBut this past week she was at a work conference and her company threw a big party the last night. There was an open bar, and she had been working really hard so I guess she just got really drunk and was kind of a mess. She was talking shit about her old boss (who works at her company but is in another department now) to anyone who would listen. Then she started dancing with random guys. She didn't even remember until one of her friends called the next day to make sure she was ok and didn't do anything stupid. She said she didn't kiss anyone or do anything other than dance, but that she was dancing \"scandalously,\" at least for a work setting. Obviously, I was very hurt, but what hurt the most was when she saw I was upset she said \"I shouldn't have told you.\" \n\nThat's when I really got upset and went to go lie down. We talked a bunch and she says she's always had self-destructive tendencies (which we've discussed before) but that she thought that was all behind her because it hadn't happened while we've been together and she said I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her, etc.\n\nShe now wants to see a therapist and stop drinking, at least for a bit and then decide whether to cut back or stop altogether. I guess I don't really have a question, I just wanted to rant a bit. But advice is welcome and I'll try to answer any questions people have. Thanks for listening.","chosen":"My fiancee got drunk at work party and danced scandalously with other guys. I was hurt and she now wants to see a therapist and stop drinking for a bit.

{"prompt":"This is such a confusing story, thanks for reading. I've been with my boyfriend for 1.5 years, we are both 26. We dated casually to start but fell in love and both think this is going to last for a long time. We're very happy together.\n\nAround 8 months ago I met his mother. She doesn't live near us, so I have only met her a couple of times, over a short period. I thought we got on well. She loved me, because I am \"rich and pretty\" (her words - I'm not rich, and pretty is subjective). My boyfriend and I went on an expensive vacation that we'd both saved up for. It was amazing. It was then that she started making derogatory comments. Saying that it was a waste of money etc. Then suddenly I was no longer invited to family events. If he would go to visit her, I wasn't welcome. It got worse. To summarize the next couple of months: it got worse until she ended up making him pick between me or her. I have no clue why. Long story short we are happy together and he has cut her off, but it wasn't without a lot of hassle including death threats to us both, and I think my boyfriend is very traumatized by what happened, although he won't talk about it.\n\nSince then we have had no contact apart from she sent him a Christmas card. However. I am SO scared she will come back. I worry that she will manipulate him into leaving me, and do terrible things to us. What can I do to get over this?

{"prompt":"I meet this girl 6 months ago. It had taken me some time to get her number but from our very first date everything was magic. She was reserved throughout mostly but at the end of the night after a little dancing I went in for the kiss. It was a first date but it went through quite nicely. Days later we spoke about the kiss and she said it was something she didn't do. She said that she wasn't like that and that she was a good girl. I said fine. That gave me confidence that I was unique while also instilling in my mind that this girl has some virtue to her(which to me is good). 2 weeks pass and we have sex. 2 months pass I'm in love. 3 months later she drops a massive bomb on me.\nShe tells me that she was traveling the world for some time and she would sleep with random guys a lot. It got so much that she was one week having sex with 3 different guys. I felt like all the stuff she told me about {she doesn't kiss on the first date and she's a good girl} were disingenuous. She even told me she was having unprotected sex with one guy because he refused to wear condoms and she just kept sleeping with him ( while sleeping with the others too).

{"prompt":"So this basically just happend to me Im a 16 year old high school student and basically what happend to me was I was cleaning out my pigs pen after school and I hear a truck I look out and see the truck along with a couple of people from my class. Everything was perfectly fine but all of a sudden I hear a \"BANG BANG\" really fucking loud and I was in the pen inside the building and during the loud BANG I heard yelling, then my stomach just dropped I was sure it was gun shots or something. It was extremely loud and had a Pop-ing sound So I droped the shovel and what I was doing and jumped over the walls seprateing the pens then sprinted out the back door onto a trail. After I got out far enough I called my Father warning him not to go the the Agriculture area. After the trail ended at a no trespassing sign I ran through bushes and branches getting scraped up until I reached the clearing where I ran down to the schools office. The first thing they notice is im shaking, sweating, and stuttering like a motherfucker and asked what happend. I reported the incident and someone went up to check it out. Turns out what happend was one of the older boys that were up there was angry and he has some issues so he grabed a pig cane and smashed it against the building twice breaking it. It takes alot of force to break one of those or even dent a building which lead me to belive it was a gun shot. But I don't know I just feel like a bit of a coward and a idiot all at the same time and feel kinda bad about myself a little bit. The boys both aplogized to me but i still feel like a jack ass. Along with having to go to that class tommrow I know for a fact my teacher is going to question me and im gonna get a call from the therapist. Also could this have any kind of long term affect on me?","chosen":"I heard a loud bang in my pig pen and thought it was gun shots, but it wasnt.

A week before, there is literally no available busses anywhere.\n\nFor the past two years now, we have thought, what are the odds of two different busses breaking down at the exact same time, 1 year apart. Bad luck I guess.\n\nBut then one of my friends brought up something that almost seemed obvious.

{"prompt":"My best friend and roommate of 2 years is a great girl with a lot to offer, but she is atrocious with her relationships, specifically breakups. In high school, she typically dealt with them by overlapping her relationship with the next guy or girl. Consequently, she doesn't know what to do with herself when she's single. In university, she decided infidelity wasn't the way, but this made matters worse. Guy #1 was crazy, egotistical, possessive, and reserved most of his wit for knowing exactly what to say to make her hate herself. Their breakup lasted over 4 months. Every night was a bloodcurdling yelling match with multiple climaxes resulting in my friend screaming and crying all at the same time. At least once a week, she would remerge from her pit of despair and proudly announce that it was done with. She even attempted dating a little bit, but this only provided more fodder for her nights with Guy#1. During this time, I tried about everything, from sappy movie nights and ice cream (that never went uninterrupted) to taking on this guy. Had he not been clinically insane, he would have seen he was no match for me, but at least I tired him out. After that, the other roommates and I started looking for a new place to live, but suddenly, my best friend found Guy #2 and the fighting slowly ended. Because he had taken an effort to get to know me and because my best friend went back to Guy #1 a week later, I gave him some friendly advice when they inevitably had a fresh start of their own: \"Leave now, there's nothing for you here.\" Sure enough, it's happening again. Luckily, Guy #2 is only crazy, egotistical, possessive, and reserves most of his wit for knowing exactly what to say to make her hate herself, but he doesn't like to raise his voice. So far, I've just been ignoring the fights and keeping her busy. Now she wants to make herself available to this ongoing viscous cycle.","chosen":"Friend gets into heated arguments that always end in tears nightly as part of her breakup process.

{"prompt":"I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this but here goes. A little background, we live in the UK, my GF lives in a different city to me due to our work, and 3 months ago started working at a new post. What I'm about to write is what I've heard from her.\n\nShe went out for a Christmas party with work colleagues and as usual involved dinner and drinks\/clubbing. At the end of the night she and her senior (A), who has a higher position, married with children, offered to walk her home. She agreed as she was a bit drunk at this point.\n\nPrevious to this she has talked about A as a mentor who has guided her through the new job an given her some good career guidance. Needless to say she trusted him as a friend.\n\nAnyway, once they were at her home he started making very aggressive advances including trying to remove her dress, kissing her & inappropriate touching. All the while she was saying 'Stop, this isn't right, you have a wife' etc. She made it quite clear about this. He continued and at one point he had removed his pants and was trying to get her to perform oral sex on him. Again she refused and he left shortly after. \n\nShe is extremely upset about this and doesn't want to report it to HR or the police as she doesn't want to relive it and would rather forget about it and try to move on, she believes this will give her closure. I can completely understand but to me the situation is much worse then she is giving off and this needs to be reported to their HR department at the very least.\n\nSince the night occurred she has only told a couple of friends (who do not know A) and me. One friend has told her not to do anything about it and says things like this happens, to me this is completely the wrong thing to say and trivialises the situation. \n\nAt the moment she is very upset and angry, (as am I, I feel by not being there I can't do anything) and would rather forget about what happened. I'm looking for a little guidance as to what I can do for her. Thanks.","chosen":"GF was sexually assaulted by a senior colleague at work and doesn't want to do anything about it as she doesn't want to relive it and would rather forget about it.

I invited a bunch of friends over to my house to have a party. Most of them didn't end up coming, but Patrice did. We were chatting it up, until I made the grave mistake of asking her to make out (don't judge me i'm an idiot).  She was hesitant, but looked at her friend for confirmation. She, the friend, said its fine, which then led up to Patrice saying don't tell Doug (I don't really know the name suits him), so we made out.

There are basically 3 groups of people I would invite: family friends, high school friends, and college friends. No one really knows anyone in a different group. I have some family friends who would come, it would be mostly adults. I'm still good friends with two people from high school. One would come and so would her family since I'm close with all of them.

Most will be doing internships or research in so many other places.\n\nWhenever my mom brings this up I ask who I would invite besides family friends and the two people from high school I still talk to. Her response is my college friends. I give her the exact same explanation I gave up. She kind of grunts and drops it until she feels like bringing it up again. She's also started to make not so subtle comments about it.

{"prompt":"Hi guys. So, the SO and I had a long talk tonight. Lots of tears and apologies and whatnot. The thing is: if he gets upset with me he'll stay mad at me for hours even if it's just a misunderstanding and if I've already apologized for it.\n\nMoreover, he gets annoyed that I get annoyed over little things (since he's a guy and he doesn't understand why these things might upset me even though I try to explain them to him). \n\nSo overall: he is doubting whether or not we are compatible because there are some fundamental things that we do which annoys the other person. \n\nI just feel like we fight a lot about silly stuff and that ultimately these things add up which makes us hesitant to talk to each other (I tend not to stand up for myself sometimes just to avoid conflict which might possibly go on for the next 10 hours).\n\nDoes this mean that we're not 'compatible'?

{"prompt":"A bit of background: my boyfriend's Mom died 4 years ago of cancer, and I never got to meet her. His Dad says I am a lot like her, and wants his son and I to get married so badly. One day, probably 8 months ago, his Dad showed me his wife's wedding ring and we talked about their wedding\/marriage, etc.\n\nSo I've seen the ring multiple times, I think it's beautiful, and my boyfriend's Dad told him to keep it in his drawer because his Dad is a crazy old man and thinks he will misplace it. My boyfriend had been trying to \"throw me off the scent\" (which I didn't know until later) by saying when he proposes, he's not sure yet if he will use his Mom's ring or a new one. So, naturally, I didn't think it mattered if I saw the ring a few times, or talked about other rings.\n\nI told my best friend about him potentially proposing with his Mom's ring and she thinks it's sweet but that I should have my own since we are \"our own relationship\". I disagree, but she makes an interesting point, so I bring up her point to my boyfriend to get his thoughts (thinking that maybe that's why he is considering using a different ring).\n\nWell shit. My boyfriend gets all upset and says that I wouldn't have brought this new-ring idea to him if I didn't think I should have my own, and that I should know how much the ring means to him and his family, and now half the surprise is ruined because I'll be mad if he gets a new ring (thinking it would be out of spite) but I won't be surprised if I see his mom's ring.\n\nSo, I effectively ruined a future proposal... innocently, but still.","chosen":"Saw boyfriend's mom's wedding ring too many times (which he likely will propose with), he got mad and said I ruined half of the surprise of the proposal.","rejected":"TIFU by potentially ruining a future proposal with an old, unimportant ring and possibly making my boyfriend feel unwanted."}

{"prompt":"Hey all, I\u2019m not sure if there is even anything I can do with my case, but at this point I am willing to try anything. I was a treasurer for a student accounting society for my university, and when some financial hardship hit, I made the idiotic decision to use my availability of funds to help front some money, with the intent to pay it back. However, before I was able to fully pay it back, the academic advisor of the group took notice and turned it over the university police who took it to the county. I was up front with all of my information and did not try to hide anything from them, knowing that they had access to all copies of the checks and had talked to the other student board members. August 14th, 2014 I was sentenced for a felony count of forgery through a county court. Being 23 and dealing with this completely on my own, I had to take a court appointed attorney, who was able to get the prosecutor to drop the other counts of forgery and embezzlement. In total, the amount in question was $4,000 which was paid as restitution in full amount on the date of sentencing. I never spent time in jail besides the 6 hours while I was waiting arraignment, I never had probation or any other court ordered conditions I unfortunately did not look into the possible pros of hiring an attorney versus taking a court appointed one, and now at 24, cannot find work. I took a year off from school in order to get my life somewhat together, I found a low paying job that did not background check, but as I approach completion of school, I am afraid of the non-existence of finding a job that will allow me to survive on my own. I know that 5 years after sentencing I can apply for expungement, but that also means I just wasted my time finishing school if I can\u2019t even find a job. Some may say that I got off easy, but looking into other similar cases, I see that restitution was paid and charges were dropped. I am just ready to move on with my life and try and bounce back from this but I feel like I\u2019m trying to swim up a waterfall.","chosen":"I got caught forgery felony.

{"prompt":"I live in a college suite of six guys, all of whom I trust and get along with greatly, so greatly in fact, that I leave my phone unlocked and lying around like an idiot.

On a side note, it is important to the story to know that I hooked up with her last semester, not to AZ's knowledge. \n\nToday, I get a series of messages from AZ, asking why I sent myself nudes of this girl from his phone and ipad.

On his ipad, the evidence is deleted. I show him my phone, and he does not believe me, which is reasonable. \n\nMy personal theory is that someone sent them on his ipad, deleted the pictures on my phone, and then deleted the messages on the ipad, knowing he would still have the imessage on his phone, and making it look like I tried to delete them.

We are very open with our feelings, have the same sick sense of humor, and tend to both be athletic.\n\nSo the issue is that we have really lost ourselves.

I think that the loss of our scheduled activities has caused us to both be a bit depressed.\n\nThe relationship has been moving quickly. She met my folks and I met her dad. We already say I love you to each other.\n\nShe has moments of distance that she attributes to missing her home and family. She has been in this city for about a year and has next to no friends. Im a bit of a workaholic and was a running addict before I met her, so I rarely see my friends.\n\nHere is the big one.. She wants to move back home, close to her family. She doesn't really the lack of her social network in this city and wants to be with her big circle back home.\n\nAfter the time I have spent with her, I think that this could potentially be someone that I could spend my life with.

There's no way that they know about it and I'm sure they just think I'm still working there. Obviously I'm not going to bring it up but if they ask me about my work there, should I just tell them that I don't work there anymore? Should I be honest and say I resigned?

{"prompt":"Hey Reddit! Thanks for reading my post.\n\nI personal view police officers an important resource in society and that having an officer in every school would be great. I have two reasons for this, one is that they can provide protection and the second is that they can be role models for kids that might not have one. So the protection part is pretty obvious, the officers have guns and bad guys avoid guns, but what people don't think about is that an officer can identify and take action against domestic violence. Another thing that gets overlooked is how much of a need there is for police outreach to kids in America and a police officer can do just that. By placing officers in schools you give the kids a chance to see that they are just normal people that want to help you, especially if you teach the cops how to tutor and put them in a basic Algebra class every now and then, that would turn so many lives around.","chosen":"Would like to know reddit's opinion on using federal money to put police officer in every primary and secondary school in the US. effect on education & child well being? plz halp","rejected":"I would love to see police officers in every school in the US.

We have sex maybe 3 or 5 times a month, and when we do it is usually satisfying for both of us.

But at the same time, he wonders whether or not he just misses being in a relationship.  He isn't sure.

Long story short, my bags got lost in Mexico City and I only received them last night. 5 days without anything kind of drained my budget pretty quickly and I need to get to Cuzco in the next few days. I have found it is pretty difficult to find out about bus companies without actually going to the bus station. The hostel I am staying in, The Point, only gives me times and prices for Cruz del Sur. It is a very safe and comfortable company, but a little bit more than I would like to pay. Also, just going to the bus station to check it out is an option, but that is another 20-30 soles I would rather not spend. I have about 115 Soles in my pocket and about 500 more available to me for about the next 8 days.  Even if I could get the ball rolling and find a cheap bus to Ica or Huacachina.

{"prompt":"Hey all, I was hoping to get some dating advice about a tricky situation I have gotten myself into over the last month.  I have been dating an awesome, attractive girl for about a month now who is exactly my type and see her every other day ~15 dates. We have been doing everything together including 3 day camping trips, cooking dinner for each other, and other various activities.\n\nOf course when I think that I found the perfect girl there has to be a problem.  This one started when we first started seeing each other and she said that she wanted to take it slow as far as waiting to have sex (that's fine).  I have to admit that I am crazy attracted to this girl and it takes every effort that I have to not touch and kiss her every time I see her.  She says i'm perfect for her and shows no lack of interest other than sexual.\n\nSo we waited around 12ish dates until we finally slept together on a camping trip.  This was two weekends ago and shes back to not sleeping with me, not handsy, etc etc.  The sex was ok, but it felt very passive and kind of just seemed like she was appeasing me.\n\nNow I really like this girl.  But no sex in a relationship is just something that I don't think I can live with right now.  She makes me feel guilty and whenever I try to go below the belt she will say something snooty like \"can I help you?\" She is by no means inexperienced and has had double the partners I have (~20) so I do not believe that is the issue.

{"prompt":"I need help reddit like never before, being a long time reader of this board I never thought I would be the one posting but this is the only place I feel like I can ask for advice..\n\nBackground: Me (30 M) and the girl (24 F) met over two years ago via mutual friends and we hit it off great, after a year we entered a relationship and just two months ago we moved in together. We have our differences and our little fights like everyone but really, everything has been wonderful, to the point where we were discussing marriage. \n\nBoth of us were raised in the foster system, I was removed from my household when I was 10, she was around 7 so we've always had this in common and been able to confide in one another about this. \n\nRecently: My biological father passed away which meant little to nothing to me since my foster father adopted me and has been absolutely great. However.. The woman I am with also received an invitation to the funeral because its her dad also.\n\nShes already packed up her things and is staying with her best friend. This situation is so screwed up I honestly didn't believe things like this could happen. I'm torn..

{"prompt":"My GF and I have been dating for four years. About a month ago, I proposed, and she accepted. Marriage was something we had been talking about for months. We both wanted it, so the proposal itself was just procedural. Our relationship has been perfect. I honestly think we've fought twice over the last 4 years. She is the love of my life.\n\nA bit about our relationship: We met on a dating website. We've been happily living together for the last 3 years. Money has not ever been an issue for us. We split things down the middle. My half comes from my job and her half comes from her parents, as she just recently graduated college and is still looking for a job. My GF's parents are well-off. Very well-off. It's obvious just from their lifestyle, and the way the support their only daughter. I have a good relationship with them. I think (thought?) they liked me we we met.\n\nMy GF told her parents immediately after the proposal and everything was great. They expressed their happiness, and actually flew down the following day. Nothing about a pre-nup was mentioned to me or her.\n\nThen, yesterday, my GF told me that her father called her and asked her if she was getting a pre-nup. She told him no, and apparently they got into an argument. My GF later told me what happened, and told me that he \"demanded\" she get a pre-nup and threatened to cut her off if she didn't. Her feeling right now is that she is mad at them and she isn't going to fold to their demand. \n\nI have a lot of problems with this. First, her parents seem to think they can control her and by extension me. Second, the fact that they used threats. Third, the fact that this didn't come up until a month AFTER we announced our engagement. Forth, what it means they think of our relationship. \n\nI don't know what is going to happen right now, hopefully this whole thing will \"go away\" but if push comes to shove I'm trying to decide if I will sign on the dotted line. Should I?","chosen":"My GF and I are engaged. Her parents asked her to sign a pre-nup. I'm not sure what to do.","rejected":"My GF and I are engaged, but her parents want a pre-nup.

{"prompt":"Just a little background, I am male (26) and my boyfriend (25) broke up with me about a month ago. We had been together for about a year and a half and he has met my entire family and we had been more or less living together, so I thought that it was getting serious. We didn't have any huge fight or anything but it was a bunch of little fights and a lack of sexual compatibility towards the end that did it. Since we broke up we've hung out and had a great time (and really great sex). He tells me that he's thought of getting back together and he misses me, but that he still needs time to figure stuff out, and he has started casually dating someone new. \n\nHe seems like he still wants to see me and have me in his life, but obviously it isn't fair to me to keep me in limbo like this (especially when he's meeting other guys), so I am doing my best to avoid seeing him and see new people myself.\n\nAlthough... I can't deny that I still love him, and if there were a chance that we could work things out I'm sure I would regret not taking it. I know big romantic gestures like in the movies usually don't work, but I was thinking of just mailing him a CD with a single song I recorded for him.\n\nI was planning on attaching a short note only saying \"I know we've talked a lot about us already, but maybe I am better expressing myself with this. I hope you are doing well.\" \n\nThe basic premise of the song stays away from phrases like \"i need you\" and is more about how I am thinking about him and that I'll be there for him in case he decides he misses me too and wants to be in my life again. Just a side note, I'm an amateur singer and he has sad that he really loves my voice in the past.\n\nIs this too desperate!?!?","chosen":"boyfriend of one year and a half broke up with me.

I have a bit of a flashy car so I knew it was just a matter of time before he came to me as I had a lot of gas to fill. When he came up to me, he started with the usual sleaze about how we must be cousins because we both drive BMWs. He had terrible, unprofessional skills and I'm surprised he's ever sold anything in his life if his current behavior was any indication as to how he approaches people.\n\nHe proceeded to test it on my car and, yes, it did seem to work but I just wasn't interested. Well, not until he said, \"Okay, you know what bro? I'm just gonna give you one. A can for free, on the house.\" Surprised, I walked over to the table where his setup was and also where a female coworker of his was standing and he then handed me a can and said, \"Okay, so it's only $10.\" Again, I was surprised, and instead of disputing his offer, I went ahead and pulled out my credit card and paid for it. Oh, and there was a $2 tax on the damn thing so it actually came out to $12.\n\nHe ran my card, handed me a receipt, and the transaction was over. I'm sure he felt good about having basically hustled me into walking over there under the impression that I'd get a free can and then actually making a sale.

However, his mother has advanced MS and has recently been through a few surgeries, and obviously has ongoing serious medical issues. She is also very depressed and difficult to be around--this summer I visited for a week, and by the end I was going crazy. She's a very strong woman, and has compensated for not being able to do a lot of things by telling other people what they should do, which gets trying very quickly. This is made worse by the fact that I'm in med school, and so she wants to confide in me all the problems she's having with all her doctors and complain about the care she's received. (This is a trait which has already alienated many friends and family members who live near her.) We're staying in the house with them and there is really no space for me to get away from the situation or have time to myself. Last christmas, she and the bf got into a fight about the very same \"telling people what to do\" issue, which ended up giving her a severe flare-up that put her in the hospital for four days during and after Christmas. Boyfriend feels guilty about this and really wants this Christmas to be better, and I'm just feeling a lot of dread.\n\nReddit, I want to be a good person and be kind, but I also don't want my christmas (the only break I get in the middle of a really killer med school year year) to be totally filled with medical problems and family drama in a family that isn't mine.","chosen":"BF's mom has MS and is very difficult to be around, but is very nice and sweet and I want to be a good person.

The only thing that has worked so far is Comfortis, but I've read of several dogs having reactions to it that can be pretty severe. My dogs are fine, we've used it for about a year now, but I don't like the idea of harming them or putting them at risk. \n\nGiving them baths with blue Dawn dish soap does kill all the fleas, but it does nothing to prevent more from coming back, obviously.

We ended up doing everything but intercourse.\n\nImmediately after, and even now, a few days later, I feel absolutely terrible and wracked with guilt, as I still love my girlfriend with all of my being.

{"prompt":"Hey Reddit,\n\nMy girlfriend of approximately a year and a half told me last night that her mother has cancer. She gave me very few details, as it was over the phone and she was pretty upset, but she did happen to say that there is a high rate of success if treated early with chemo. I've met both of her parents, and they are wonderful and generous people. Basically, I'm looking for advice on how to approach her and provide the right kind of emotional support. I've been very lucky so far in my life, not having gone through a situation like this with a loved one so close to me, but I think that's put me at a disadvantage in terms of knowing how to connect to my girlfriend now. My dad is an existentialist, and I share his mindset to some extent, so I'm really not the best at providing emotional support. I'm also a staunch atheist, and she's one the fence, so I want to be very careful not to interject my thoughts at a time when she might be turning to something I don't believe in. She's an amazing and beautiful girl, and I want to find a way to be more helpful through this process. Does anyone have suggestions about what to say on a daily basis, and maybe how to treat things through the longer term?

This will propbably lead to us hooking up and I would not be far out by saying it will probably lead to sex aswell. I would also not be far out by saying this will lead us to becoming fuck friends aswell. While I can honstley say that I have fantasized about having sex with her, now that the opportunity has presented itself I'm not sure what to do. \nOne part of me wants to have sex with her and see how it is since it ruined my relationship and I wouldn't mind having her as a fuck friend(she is smoking hot). But another part of me wonders if this will make it akward to stay friends, I really treasure her as one of my best friends and I really don't want to lose her as my friend because of this. \n\nAnd that is my problem Reddit, what do you guys think I should do?","chosen":"I'm a 20 year old male and I'm not sure what to do in this situation with a girl I'm very close with.","rejected":"I got a text from my best friend asking if we should hang out tomorrow night and I said yes, but I'm not sure if it will make it akward to stay friends or not."}
{"prompt":"Me [15 M] and my GF [14 F] have been together for a little over two months now. Pretty early on, she told me how she was blackmailed into having sex with a horrible guy who was only interested in her body (this was about a month before we met). GF started crying the first time she told me and thought I wouldn't think of her the same way again. I understand that it wasn't voluntary, but this isn't the whole problem.\n\nI think this information has had some lasting effects on me. When my GF first told me this, I was infuriated (at the guy who did this, not her), but told her that it's ok, and that she can be a virgin again. We're both religious, so I threw some of that in my explaining to her. \n\nI think I was, and still kinda am again, so angry with this guy because I believe he took something very important form her. I don't want to sound selfish or something, but I can't help but think that your virginity should be something shared with someone very important to you, which we both are to each other. I am a virgin, and have no plans on having sex with my GF anytime soon, but I wanted our virginities to be shared with each other, and now that can't really happen. I tell her (and myself) that virginity is just a concept, but I've still made myself nearly sick thinking about all this. For about a week after she first told me, I cried just thinking about it.\n\nEssentially, I am livid about this guy, because he took my GF's virginity, when I believe that i should've been the one to do that. Whether I'm just being selfish, or we're just young and naive, I'm not sure. All I know is that this is keeping me from thinking clearly throughout the day. Maybe just posting about this will help me out, I don't know.","chosen":"My GF told me how she was blackmailed into having sex with a horrible guy before we met.

{"prompt":"Sorry if this is TMI but here we go:\n\nI've been dating my boyfriend for about 6 months.  I think the sex is great, but he's more experienced that I am.  So far, he's seemed to enjoy it.  \n\nI do have a bit of an issue with premature ejaculation, but there's ways we can do it to avoid it (i.e. changing positions, etc).  \n\nHowever, the other day, we were having sex (I was the receptive partner) and I finished about a minute before he did.  He didn't notice, and after he finished, he made a comment about it being my turn to finish.  I told him I already had, and he goes \"I thought I might've come first..... for once.\"  It was a kind of off putting.  He knows its a sensitive subject (LOL).\n\nI told him I was trying my best and doing techniques to last longer each time, to which he replied, \"you know, you could just go on an SSRI, that would just fix everything.\"\n\nI kinda laughed it off, but I was really turned off by that comment.   I'm not opposed to medications at all for their intended use, but asking your SO to go on an SSRI seems pretty serious, especially just for the sexual side effects.  \n\nAm I wrong for being turned off by that comment?","chosen":"Boyfriend suggested I go on an SSRI just to fix my pre-ejaculation problems.

{"prompt":"Okay, so I've been with my bf for three months, and most of the time, it's great. We get along together splendidly, really enjoy each other's company, and the sex is just great.\n\nThe thing is, I'm getting really self-conscious about suggesting spending evenings alone when we're both really tired because he usually reclines. Today is a great example. We both had a long day at work, plus we didn't really sleep well last night because of the heat... So we were just IMing about what we would do tonight, he said he wanted to stay home so I suggested I'd come over. Just to watch a movie or something. The last time we did this, he said two or three times \"Why don't we do this every night?\" But, he said he just wanted to relax, plan his holiday and pursue his hobby (Sorry if that's not the right expression, English is my second language).\n\nThis would be fine if this was the first time it happened, but it's not. Usually, when I say \"let's just spend the night at home\" because we both don't want to go out, he declines it in like 75%. Which made me kind of stop wanting to suggest this. Rejection sucks. \n\nThe thing is, I don't know if I should bring it up. He's normally an amazing boyfriend, treats me way better than the guys I dated before him, constantly says he loves me and I feel I'd be unfair to make this allegation when he's so great in every other way. Plus, I'm afraid he'd beat himself up about it, which is something I don't want him to.\n\n(I should probably add that it's not that we don't spend time alone together, it's just when he's tired he can't seem to get himself to see me, I guess)\n\nSo, any advice would be appreciated, thanks!","chosen":"Boyfriend wants to spend nights alone, I don't want to because he's great in every other way.

{"prompt":"Hello \/r\/relationships,\n\nLike the title says, I'm 18 and I met a girl over the internet that I really started liking the first day already although she did not have a real picture of her face uploaded. She was afraid of showing her face to everyone on that app and she also didn't want to send me a picture in the private chat at first. After I changed my picture, she messaged me about it and I then said that I really want to see her face. She delivered and sent me a picture which made me very happy. Anyway, we were chatting throughout the last weeks and got along very well.\n\nYesterday she asked me why I did download the app where people can 'meet' each other. I told her because of the reason she also mentioned on her profile and that's kind of something like 'Whatever happens'. She then sent me a smiley and said she was going to sleep. I responded with 'Yeah, good night and sleep well, Beauty'. She did read that message but didn't respond.\n\nIn the next morning, I asked her if she slept well and how she feels like. She said that she didn't sleep too well. I asked her why that was and she mentioned that she doesn't really know and she might've thought too much about something. I said that I'm always there to listen to her and she said 'Maybe later :)'.\n\nShe asked me if I'm always that nice and friendly and I said that it depends on who I am talking to. I also mentioned that she's the only girl I'm messaging (which really is true) and that she's beeing very sympathic. She told me the same about me beeing sympathic and I just felt very happy.\n\nNow I just wonder if these are good signs. I was considering to ask her for a date in like a month or so.

I wait hours and hours, and text her \"are you up for tonight?\" with no response.  I see she is liking photos on Facebook, so I know she saw it.\n\nWhat the hell?  I'm actually angry right now.

We never argued a lot, but there were very rare occurrences when we didn't get along. I had already been ignored for a week once--as if my presence wasn't there at all--and I always assumed it was simply because I had said something wrong (I apologise to her, I swear). But we would always get along, eventually.\n\nIn the remaining several days before we had to part for summer, our interactions were becoming a little awkward, and it was with the knowledge that I would already be attending a different school from hers when classes return. In those days, I would see her making conversations with other students rather than me. She would always speak to my only other best friend (the three of us have been really close friends for > 4 years), and not include me in the conversation. My online messages are all unread. I have, of course, asked her if I had done something wrong; she would say \"no\", as always, without looking me in the eye.\n\nAnd now she has finally blocked me in social media. 3 months have passed now, and I cannot even fathom what wrong I could have possibly done.

{"prompt":"I decided yesterday to leave my window open with a fan in front of it to let some fresher, cooler air in. It was open all day and kept the place relatively livable. At bedtime (aka 3 am) I go to my comfortably cool bedroom. I remember that the screen to my window had fallen off last summer. I think, \"phew, lucky the cat didn't go jumping out a two story window huh.\" I close the window, take off my pants, turn off my fishtank light and get in bed while calling my girlfriend on facetime. \nSOMETHING hits me in the face. It's dark, I don't know what it is. Figure it was a piece of hair or something dumb like that. But it keeps happening, as my girlfriend laughs at me freaking out from her safe distance inside my iphone. Finally, the thing that hit me in the face appears in the light of my phone, which it's clearly attracted to. It's a moth. I laugh it off and turn on the light so I can squish the motherfucker and sleep tight. As I turn on the light another one hits me in the face. I kill the one that's landed on the wall next to me, and go looking for the other one. \nThis is where I realize just how much I've fucked up. They must have been attracted to the light in my fish tank, and the window was open for hours. Now, I'm not scared of moths particularly, but this was an INCREDIBLE amount of moths in one place. And to make it even worse, my fan was drawing them in and turning them into projectiles aimed straight at me. I couldn't possibly find all of them, or get them to all stop flying long enough to kill them. I killed a few but my efforts were futile. There were so many fucking moths. \nI decided to give up my murder spree and just build an inpenetrable blanket fort around me, my bed, and my iphone so I could sleep in moth-free, albeit stuffy peace.

{"prompt":"Okay, so I've been with my bf for three months, and most of the time, it's great. We get along together splendidly, really enjoy each other's company, and the sex is just great.\n\nThe thing is, I'm getting really self-conscious about suggesting spending evenings alone when we're both really tired because he usually reclines. Today is a great example. We both had a long day at work, plus we didn't really sleep well last night because of the heat... So we were just IMing about what we would do tonight, he said he wanted to stay home so I suggested I'd come over. Just to watch a movie or something.

He's normally an amazing boyfriend, treats me way better than the guys I dated before him, constantly says he loves me and I feel I'd be unfair to make this allegation when he's so great in every other way.

That is jealousy, which I am sure is a prime topic in this subreddit. It was never really a problem until my partner began to talk more with a male friend that she admitted to liking before we started seeing one another. I have met this friend in particular and he's a nice guy, and she's still friends with him, but I can't stop myself from feeling constant jealousy.\n\nI have read many articles detailing how to control and vanquish jealousy, but I still feel myself compelled to be wary of when she is with or talking to other guys.

Yet I still can't lose grip of the jealous feelings I have! I truly have no reason to feel that way, as she has been incredibly loyal and helpful in trying to get me to understand that she wants no else but me, that I'm her best friend, etc. I have told her about how I feel and it has resulted in some pretty deep conversations about it, but only to help me. I was cheated on in my last relationship but I don't think that is affecting me in any way, as it wasn't too severe. However, I still unable to push myself over this jealousy. I want her to have friends of both genders because I know at the end of the day, it will be me and her sharing a bed, cuddling, talking about our problems, and all of the other stuff that two partners, couples, best friends do.

{"prompt":"Hello all, and thanks in advance. So, I have been an athlete my whole life, started competitive soccer and other sports when I was 5 (27 now), and have always considered myself physically fit. About 4 years ago, I moved to Hawaii and basically became a beach potato with almost no consistent physical activity for the first time in my life. A year and a half ago, I had a baby with my fiance, moved back to the Mainland, and decided I needed to get my life on track for the benefit of my child (now children). So I quit smoking tobacco and signed up for a half marathon. I was doing my best to follow a training program I found on Garmin Connect, but about 8 weeks into the training I started pushing too hard, running too many miles too fast, a classic rookie maneuver, I know, but it felt so good to build strength in my body and I began to rely on the peaceful solace I found running alone, away from the chaos of raising now 2 small children. Anyway, after a nice long run, a hot shower and a nap, I squatted slightly to pick up my son, and I felt a *pop* in my 2nd toe on my left foot. It swelled immediately, and was painful to walk on, let alone run, for (the past) 6-7 weeks, and although MUCH improved this past 2 weeks, I still feel it occasionally. I did some research and I think it may be either Metatarsalgia or Capsulitis, the symptoms match both somewhat. So my questions are these: would it be stupid to try and run again before the symptoms completely dissipate? and when I do start running again, what mileage is safe? Should I start with a c25k (really don't want to be re-injured)? I was running 5-6 miles 4 days a week, with a long run about 8 miles, again, from not running in years in about an 8-10 week span.\nThanks for the help, and all the inspiration and motivation!

Playing games is as mainstream as it gets.\n\nNo, it's about the culture that I think is frankly ridiculous. It's a bunch of nostalgia circlejerks and pseudo inside jokes for things that are actually quite popular (took an arrow to the knee, etc.) It doesn't matter if the latest call of duty (for example) is good or not, what matters is whether it's popular with \"gamers.\"\n\n\"CoD is the same every time but the new Pokemon is pretty swell.\" \n\nThis hypocrisy and favoritism makes my blood boil. I've never played call of duty because it's not my cup of tea, not because \"that's what casuals play.\" The whole PC master race also irritates me.

Fred is tiny, only about 4'6\", whereas these others boys are well over five feet tall.

{"prompt":"I'm writing on my phone so I apologize for any mistakes in advance. We recently started a friend with benefits relationship after being close friends for 8 years and he made it clear it was not exclusive at the beginning but that he would tell me if he slept with anyone else. He hinted that he did things with another girl and I acted emotionally and looked through his messages. I was completely in the wrong for this and I know that. I found that he got a blowjob \/went down on her, and confronted him about it and he said he did but that he didn't sleep with anyone else because he didn't want to betray my trust. I believe him 100% on this. He said that this was a huge fucking betrayal of trust to him and that we're done and he wants to cut contact. He believes in second chances but apparently I used it when I hurt him by accidentally calling him by my Ex's name in bed one time. He said emotionally he still cares for me and it makes him happy to make me happy, but logically it's better to cut it off as the trust is gone.\n\nHe means a lot to me and I really can't just watch what we've had go down the drain from this one mistake I made. I'm thinking of asking him for a second chance by saying the name incident didn't impact our friendship, and that this incident is the first time I've betrayed his trust and damaged our friendship. \n\nHe's a very logical person, this is likely the only email I'll send, I'll let it go if he doesn't agree after this.

I pay for everything now, with the deal that he will pay me back his half later. He said he would pay half of the rent out of his savings. \n  He's applied for about two hundred jobs, with no leads.

Well I was very overconfident and it led to some real problems.\n\nOn a short (6 mile round trip) half day hike on the Appalachian Trail, I went off trail to look at a rock formation about .25 miles away. Instead of turning back to the trail I decided to keep going up and over the mountain through light undergrowth and widely spaced trees.

BIG MISTAKES.\n\nWhat I thought would be a 10 minute walk that would intersect the trail at the crest of the ridge turned into an over two hour bushwhack through heavy vegetation, but I continued to push forward farther off trail.

Eventually after descending to a creek, I recalled a map I had looked at earlier which showed a creek crossing the trail about 3 miles into the hike. I ended up following that creek through even more heavy vegetation until I eventually intersected the trail again only about half a mile from where I originally left it. \n\nSo TIFU by abandoning some of the core principles of hiking safety: I was not prepared beyond half a days worth of water.

One day she literally grabbed me and took me to a more private place so she could tell me she really wanted to be with me and that this time apart had allowed her to realize how wrong she was and how much she had hurt me. I decided to give her a chance. \n\nProblems arose when she found out I had gone out with another girl and gone to places she considered 'ours'. She demanded that I completely stop talking to her, delete her from fb and things like that. \n\nSix months later I moved to another city about 250 miles away. I work during the day so I don't really talk to her a lot during the day. In the afternoon we used to skype and talk. I started to get into gaming and she complained that I would not stop playing to talk to her (you can't pause online games). Eventually our conversations turned into fights because she felt I did not do anything for her. For months I visited about every 1-3 weeks (during the weekends, 4+ hour bus ride each way). This was a pretty big expense for me to maintain. \n\nI am not someone who can maintain long conversations, I'm very pragmatic. I'll say what I need to say without taking detours. At some point she'd cry every time I talked to her because she claimed I did not care for her when I did. After 5 or 6 months of this she said she wants to break up and I will be going back there soon to attend a party in which she will be present. What can I do? She won't move with me.","chosen":"Gf has become very high maintenance due to long distance relationship, wants out, now says she will be returning to where I am soon to attend a party.

{"prompt":"Last post: \n\nSo I heard what you guys said... Again. I talked to her about it but she was pretty set about doing it over 1-2 months. I argued with her a bit saying that it will create drama since she'd be replying to him less and less over a course of time. This did happen before as she ignored him because she wanted to indirectly say that she didn't like him. Anyways, I told her I could tolerate her doing it over a course of time but just last night, she told me that she cut him off. \n\nNow, she's pretty sad. Her main reason for being sad is because she had lots of memories with him and now, she doesn't have anyone other than me to talk to everyday. She says she feels lonely and I don't know what to do. (Her dad is very controlling and rarely lets her go out to see her friends) \n\nI feel extremely bad about telling her to cut him off. For me, I was in a band in my senior year and we have an active Facebook group chat and when I was showing her some funny messages today to try and cheer her up, she got all quiet and got sad.

{"prompt":"I want to start off by saying my sister is an amazing personality and she's a fabulous woman, but there's a serious problem with her when it comes down to her body odor and body care. My little sister has ALWAYS fought people when they bring up her body odor, we've even brought her to a doctor once after we made her shower for a full week in a row to see if the smell will disappear - but it didn't, it actually got 10x worse. The doctor said the smell seemed more with her care of her body and surroundings than anything else, so that was that. After that, every time ANYONE brought up the hygiene issue, she would not make any excuses, she would actually do the total opposite - she becomes verbally abusive, result to names and then make it almost intolerable to talk to her.\n\nCut to two weeks ago, her friend had brought her home from school and I admit, her odor was fairly strong that day. My sister didn't see it, but her friend hosed her car with febreeze and rolled her windows down before pulling away. I didn't tell her, but I sure did bring her odor up again and was met with, again, verbally abusive language and behavior. \n\nAnother incident that happened is my sister went to use the bathroom on a following day while I had friends over. Her scent was SO OVERPOWERING that when my friend went in, he immediately came out and he had a visibly disturbed look on his face. He, having been my friend since elementary school, was honest with me and told me he smelled some really bad in our bathroom. I checked, it was indeed my sister's odor as it tends to linger. \n\nTHEN another incident where we went to the store, she was elsewhere in the establishment and I was in one aisle with another woman, who was 100% perfectly fine...until my sister showed up.

It was a week late (which would not have bothered me had he not utterly ruined my birthday) and it was just full of candy and a bag for a show that I sorta like and sorta hate (including the receipt for the bag $6.50 from Hot Topic).

Eventually it was like her whole neck had a cut all the way around and I desperately held her head on her body trying to prevent her bleeding out. I had this feeling of absolute dread that my dog was going to die, bleeding out in my arms. I was screaming for help, I couldn't move her as it would expedite her death.

{"prompt":"It rained!!! (Guess where I'm from) I got my drivers permit about 2 months ago, bought a car two weeks later with my hard earned money from the summer. The car was shitty to others but a full blown race car to me. Looked like crap but ran like a champ. Anyways, I have never driven in the rain so I knew I'll run into trouble on my way back home from work. Hydro planing sounded familiar to me but never knew it's real consequences. Coming up to my turn where for a good mile (in Dominic torretto voice) I'm free. On the turn there was a huge size puddle of water. I tried to avoid it completly but knew and figured that the front right tire will hit the water. Remember that word \"hydroplane\", yeah I fucked up. The left front tire went over then sunk, causing me the turn into the side of the road. Closer to the edge, the water is deeper. My engine choked, I'm really fucked. Knew trying to keep turning the key will only make things worst. I got out, in ankle deep water, had the bitch in neutral and pushed to the corner of the turn. On the bright side of this whole predicament, a trucker got out of his rig and helped me push the water logged car to the edge. Once out of the water, I tried to give life to my racecar. Once she turned back on I booked it home. Ran the same as before except for a knocking noise. The noise just hurts thinking about it. From the advice from other gearheads, it can't be easy to fix or safe to use without causing more damage. Already made a craigslist ad to at least get some money for another one.

{"prompt":"I have a fetish that involves watching an everyday activity. This activity is not remotely sexual for most people and is something they often do socially. It's impossible to avoid entirely. \n\nOccasionally when I'm around family members and they're doing this activity, I'll feel a small bit of arousal coupled with A LOT of anxiety. I find myself wishing I had headphones on so I could look away and ignore the activity altogether - but that would be rude in a social setting and could draw attention to me. I feel panicked, suffocated, trapped and unable to talk out of shame. A couple of times I've quickly made an excuse and fled the room. Other times I've been irritable and rude, unable to focus on anything that's going on. Still other times I've been distracted enough not to be worried by it, or just not bothered by it at all.

I feel like she might be trying to do that with me and my girlfriend.\n\nWhenever my girlfriend hangs out with K, it's this huge thing where I feel like I can't even go into the same room as them. My girlfriend won't answer my texts because K says that it's her time. \n\nThe main reason why I'm upset is because K bad mouthed me in front of someone who used to have a crush on my girlfriend. That girl then proceeded to set me aside at a party and have a full blown conversation with me for over 30 minutes that I really didn't want to be a part of. Whenever my girlfriend hangs out with K, it feels like a little stab in the back. Like she doesn't care that K trash talked me to someone.

{"prompt":"I am coming to reddit because so far I haven't been able to find a legit animal behavioralist in my area. (I understand reddit is no substitute for that.)\n\nA little background. . . I have a 3 year old Australian Shepherd. He is very well behaved for the most part. He listens to all basic commands and makes good eye contact most of the time. He is quite defensive of the yard and property. If someone comes to the door or a loud car drives by he barks and growls. He quickly quiets down when you ask him to. (Most of the time except when he is in the yard alone) He gets along very well with other dogs and people. If someone new is coming to the house he is standoffish at first but quickly is very friendly. (As long as I say its ok) He is well excercised for the most part. (Walk to a field and then 45 minutes+ of running\/fetch\/frisbee) In the winter time he goes outside less but doesn't seem to act any differently. I do alot of indoor training\/play with him as well.\n\nThe other day my friends phone rang and he stood up about to answered it. At the same time my dog started growling and attacked him. He stopped after a few seconds (gave him sit commands etc) but was still very heated. My friend went in the other room for his phone call and it seemed like my dog wanted to follow him. We both thought the ringtone agitated him.\n\nAre there any clear cut training methods to stop this behavior? It happened twice now with two different people.

Unfortunately, he mostly seems to be interested when we include the hose.\n\nHe insists on me accepting him as he is and his fetish. Which is as it should be, but for him accepting it means he doesn't have to try sex any other way. He does not go down on me because he doesn't like it. We have no spontaneous sex because for him it's a big production with the hose and the dressing up and the setup. For two years I've asked him to indulge my super vanilla fantasy of having sex in the shower, but no - he says sex and water don't go together and that he's just uncomfortable. Basically, we do it his way (in bed in the evening, lights on, curtains drawn, with the hose) or not at all.\n\nI've always been attracted to him though because he is a big masculine guy and that is my type.

{"prompt":"I think it is normal to ditch condoms in long term monogamous relationships. I have been on the birth control pill for 3 years, had unprotected sex many times with my previous partner and have never been pregnant. I take my birth control religiously because neither he nor I are anywhere near ready to have a child. If I were to become pregnant, I would have an abortion, and I have expressed this to my boyfriend. I do not have any STI\/Ds.\n\nMy boyfriend insists on using a condom every time and laughs when I bring up not using a condom, his only explanation being that using condoms is \"just something he likes to do\". I don't like condoms because it feels much less intimate, the feeling of skin is very different from rubber, and because condoms dry me out and sex becomes difficult\/painful. The way he reacts whenever I bring up not using condoms makes me feel like he doesn't trust me, and he has said things that imply that he thinks most women are looking to get knocked up by their long term partners.

{"prompt":"It's all very nice that people can make changes in their lives to make it go away, but for many or most, that does not help at all. If you have been feeling depressed for a time longer than six months, and\/or it interferes with your life, see a counselor AND GP. Sure, many have factors in their lives which cause them to feel this way, but many are genetically predisposed to the condition and no scenery change or 'opening up' will change that.\n\nGo to a counselor (not a psychiatrist) to determine whether your problems are psychological, and a GP to determine whether it is at all related to any physical issues that you may have (allergies, diet, et cetera). Go to a specialist at the recommendation of your counselor and GP. Starting with a specialist can be problematic, first because it may cost you unnecessarily, and second because, at least in my experience, someone who limits their field of work can sometimes limit their field of vision. Unnecessary treatment and incorrect diagnosis kind of suck. So, start out with a wide view, and work your way toward a more focused treatment.\n\nDon't just wait for it to get better, and don't expect the world to get better with a change of location.

Both TW and the agency were WAY less than helpful on the phone today, and I'll have to spend some more time with them tomorrow... but it will be resolved, at least in terms of me not having to pay. \n\nBUT, the real issue is that I'm about to go to Law School this fall, and I'm looking down the pipe of about $50k in private student loans that I need to apply for this summer (to cover the first year).

Monthly visits, summers together. Most communication is through text, and IM; we rarely skype.\n\nThe time we spend together is great, I have no problems with this, but this last semester has simply been a train wreck of issues, arguments and petty insults. I've tried to break up with her twice already and I couldn't go through with it. The break ups happened because she started acting really detached and rarely speaking to me, and she  wouldn't leave me alone about a girl I liked before I met her. At the time I hadn't spoken to the aforementioned girl for length of our relationship (we can refer to her as May). The crying and the promises she made made me hope for a better future, and it was good for a little while.\n\nShe has been insecure before, but I always reassured her at every move. Recently, I haven't been reassuring her and I don't want to. I've grown tired of having to help her through so many of her issues; I mean i've been reassuring her constantly for just under 2 years. \n\nIt shames me to say this  but, I have been looking at over women in her presence; she's caught me before.

{"prompt":"Last night I experienced my first ever absolutely miserable run where instead of feeling energized and accomplished when it was over, I lay on my bathroom floor shivering and hugging the toilet. \n\nI have had frustrating runs before and I have had runs when my knee\/ankle\/toe hurt and made me want to quit but last night was far worse than any of those. \n\nEarlier in the day, I ate a sandwich and fell asleep on the couch for a two hour surprise nap. When I woke up my stomach was slightly unsettled like I was about to have heartburn. I decided to do out for my long run anyways because I always have heartburn and it doesn't usually stop me. This run was scheduled to be my longest yet at 1:30:00 (I am training for a half).\n\nAt about 45 minutes I started to get stomach cramps so I slowed how much water I was taking in. The entire run I had to walk several times which is unusual for me but my times were better than expected so I thought I was just pushing too hard and tried to take it easy on the way back. \n\nMy post long run ritual is usually to drink several long drinks once I get back to the car since now I won't be jostling my innards around, I can do what I want. When I got home, I felt like I probably shouldn't try eating right away so I had about 1\/3 bottle of Gatorade. \n\nWell...Gatorade was the wrong answer. Within 20 minutes I was violently heaving into my kitchen garbage and I lost all of the Gatorade and likely most of the water I had while running. \n\nMy question is, do I blame my sandwich from earlier or my run?

But after I got her number it seems that she is pretty bad at the whole texting thing. What I mean by this is just basically if I text her she will either take quite a while to respond to my message or she just won't respond at all (even sometimes if the text has a question in it). And so far after probably a little more than a month being decent friends she has NEVER initiated the texts, it has always been me. Recently at a school bar night we were both drunk and she literally dragged me to the dance floor with her (which is extremely abnormal for me) so I'm thinking this was a sign of interest.

I had a curfew to  be home by, and wouldnt care, he'd keep me pinned on the table grinding his nasty body against mine. I would tell him I didnt want this to happen, that I wasnt comfortable, and he told me that if I didnt go along with it that he would spread word around that I was sleeping with all these different guys, that I was smokin' it up everyday, that I cheated on my past boyfriends with someone else, etc. So naturally I was scared to say anything against what he \"wanted to do.\"  Along with pinning me down, he would take my hand and force me to give him a handjob and would try to thrust my head down to give him a blowjob as well. \n\nThis happened on numerous occasions...I feel so guilty right now for not laying down ground rules and boundaries, and Im full of regret that had anything to do with him. \nWhat scares me though is that this all happened in September-October 2011, and I just filed sexual harrassment against him last month or so. The reason I waited so long was because I was afraid to talk about it to anybody, I was constantly angry so I distanced myself from people. Until I finally opened up to one of my closest friends about what he did, and she suggested I file sexual assault.\nSo now I have to write a victim impact statement, and I was wondering if Reddit had any tips for doing that?

I've been supportive and tried to hear her out, offer advice if asked, and try to make her happy still whenever the opportunity presents itself.  But the relationship has been growing colder from her end, and more than once she's told me she's been yelling at me just to hurt me and act out.  She is an only child and states that \"this is how I (she) am, I'm selfish and you should know that about me\".   She has flat out told me that my presence in the apartment now is distressing for her, and its starting to make me feel like I'm unwanted here.  \n\nThis is despite the fact that I have helped move her out of her old place on my own while she was too busy at work, sacrificed my own time on setting up her (our) new place, dealt with my own family members turning gravely sick (for which she hasn't even tried talking to me about despite me being obviously distressed about it) and have been  solely taking care of a new dog we got together.\n\nI know it sounds like I'm rambling, but I've talked with her a lot about these issues and been very direct about how I feel that she's taking her frustrations about her job\/personal responsibilities out on our relationship and on me....

Luckily, he received primary treatments, and his cancer is in remission. \n\nHowever, he was medically advised to get post-chemo treatment to make sure that the cancer hasn't spread (it was a particularly aggressive type). These were supposed to last for 5 years, twice a month for one year, once a month for the next year, and once every couple months for years 3-5. He had surgery to remove the tumors 3 months ago. \n\nHe had been insured under the policy my dad got through his job, but my dad's company tanked recently and my parents lost almost everything they had (including our family home). My brother told me today that he missed one insurance payment last month, and now the insurance company has dropped him as a client. \n\nThis means that he is facing the next 5 years without any medical help. No doctors, no medication, nothing.\n\nThere has to be something I can do, but I'm just kind of shocked.

I'm afraid that she will be freaked out by what I have done.\nsince the fight, I haven't attempted to or actually made any kind of emotional connection with a girl, but have been with close to 50 girls in the past year. I saw no reason to want to talk to them after I had gotten them but I've started to care for this one.\nI want to eventually be able to tell her about it because it wouldn't be smart to keep a secret this big from someone when it was extremely likely that she will find out, but i want to show her that what I did i'snt a reflection of who I really am before I tell her.\n\nshould I leave it sooner or later before telling her or should I just avoid telling her?","chosen":"Got in a fight, got convicted of assault, Id like to eventually tell a girl I'm dating that I did this. but not sure if I should","rejected":"I got into a fight with someone and got convicted of assault, but I'm only getting community service done now and I'm afraid that she will find out."}
{"prompt":"So I'm going to visit a friend of mine in another state in a little over a month. We've been friends for over ten years and we've always gotten along really well. She's smart and she's attractive, we know how to make each other laugh and we have a lot in common. I think that there could be more than just a friendship here, there could be relationship potential.\n\nA little background: This girl and I have known each other since college. She used to date one of my best friends, but we've known each other since before that relationship and have kept in touch since then. We drifted apart for a couple of years after they broke up but have gotten back in touch and have grown closer as friends over the last couple of years. I would have said something to her sooner, but I was in another relationship anyway until about two years ago and until know I've been reluctant to pursue someone my friend had dated.\n\nThe question is, when is the best time to bring this up? The tickets are purchased and I'll make the trip regardless. I have no doubt that it will be a fun visit either way. Should I say something before I get on the plane to go visit? Should I wait until I get there and can ask her in person?

{"prompt":"Yesterday, I was accelerating on the on-ramp, reaching the speed of the flow of traffic (~70 mph, ~110 kph).

At this point, I realize the on-ramp is ending and I have about 500 feet until it ends. I slam on the brakes to reach 50 mph (~80 kph), merge lanes as the on-ram is ending. I gain some space between the truck and myself, then move to the left lane and pass him. I look in the rear-view mirror and see the vehicle thats in front of the tractor trailer is going about 5 mph (~8 kph) below the speed limit. The tractor trailer moves into my lane, at which point I slow down to the speed of the vehicle the 18 wheeler was trying to pass. Once I slow down, the tractor trailer turned his blinker to move back into the right lane; I then sped up and the 18 wheeler turned off his blinker. Once it went off, I slowed back down and then the 18 wheeler turned his blinker back on. This went on for a couple of miles, until my exit came up.

I (23M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) for just about six months. For pretty much the entire relationship we have been having sex around two to three a week. The frequency of our sex has remained relatively consistent throughout or relationship, although as of recently is becoming less frequent. \n    Whats bothering me the most though is her lack of interest when it comes to sex. At the beginning of our relationship she would often be the first to initiate via flirty texts, kissing ect. But as of recently She has shown practically no interest in sex. I will try to initiate but more often than not i'll get shut down. And when we do have sex it feels like she does it just to appease me. Like she'll say \"I guess we can have sex if you want to\" which to me is a total turn off. \n     I feel like it is important to note that she has told me time and time again that this is the best sex of her life (she gets off almost every time) and she is completely happy with our sex life. Like I said earlier I'm not sure whether we are heading towards a dead bedroom or whether I am being paranoid. Obviously I have a Higher sex drive then her and although I would love to have sex more often, I understand that her sex drive is lower and I'm fine with twice a week.

Last night my girlfriend's dad gave her a long winded conversation of basically why he doesn't like me, how apparently he thinks I'm not going anywhere in life (to be fair I'm only a student in my 2nd year of Architecture technology, not sure where he got that idea from), he also said I don't talk to him enough when he's never really tried to make conversation with me and says I don't look him in the eye which I have, not sure where that's coming from either, point is he doesn't like me. She mostly thinks it has to due with him being raised by an abusive father, for he kept saying to her well I would never bring a girl to my house when I was your age, which my girlfriend said to me she wouldn't have either if she lived in that house. On a side, my girlfriend has cerebrallypalsy affecting the right side of her brain but its an extremely mild case. The only things she can't really do is drive and cut her own food and other two handed tasks that most people take for granted. So I guess because of this her parents are a little bit more protective. But last night my girlfriend's Father also compared her to her older brother and older sister, saying he never had to deal with any of this from them, (neither of them have any disabilities) so my girlfriend got pretty upset and doesn't know what to do. She wants to move out but her mom won't let  her. I say they shouldn't have it both ways but I'm worried they're going to make her dump me regardless.","chosen":"My girlfriend and I have been dating for a while but her dad wants to put a stop to it because he doesn't think I'm good enough for her, what should we do?","rejected":"girlfriend's father has a problem with me (in his opinion) and doesn't think I'm ready for a relationship, his reasons are a little weird and we're not sure what to do."}
{"prompt":"Obvious throw away account because I post and comment allot and just need some quick advice. \n\nSo a while ago I made an OKCupid account and started talking to some people there. I met this one girl who seemed really awesome. We started meeting up and have become quite good friends. \n\nAbout a month ago I invited her over to my place to hang out, watch a movie, jam on guitar etc etc. The evening went really well and when she sent me a message not 10 mins after leaving saying that she really enjoyed herself. So, I bit the bullet and decided to tell her how I felt. All I got from her was that we have loads in common but she's happier with us as friends at the moment. I was kind of bummed because we seemed to get on so well and have something going. \n\nThinking that was it, I put it out of my mind (after much difficulty) and got on with things. We went out again just before I graduated and spent the entire day together walking in London and sitting around in parks. It was really great and it's frustrating how well we get on, knowing that she doesn't want anything more.\n\nAfter this I went travelling for a few months (post-graduation trip). Whilst I was away she got in touch asking me out again. This is where my problem is, we went out and again spent hours just sitting around chatting. I can't help but think maybe I've done something wrong, or have I just got the wrong idea? I asked her out to a gig tonight and even though she's got something else on she's cutting it short to come and hang out. I just don't know what to think. When we're together things seem amazing but when I asked her about it she wasn't so sure. \n\nI should say that she's very shy and I believe her previous relationship was quite a serious long one (5 years or so).\n\nThanks for any advice the great hive mind of Reddit can give!","chosen":"met girl online.

{"prompt":"So last year I wasn't able to file taxes.  Like I usually do, I used Tax Act to set up my taxes and ended up having to owe both state and federal (which usually happens, but for some reason it was more this year).

So now this year, Im not really sure what to do.  I have no kids, been renting the same apartment for a few years, have a car payment, work two jobs (one part time) make about 40,000-45,000 a year; so my taxes shouldnt be to difficult.  Im just not sure what to do since I didn't file them last year.  Money situation is kind of tight right now and like I said I owe money to federal and state for the 2015 year.  Not really sure if I will owe this year (I shouldn't because I now know longer have a 1099-G from unemployment to file). \n\n Is there a way I can see If I'm getting a refund for this year so I can pay off what I owe last year?  Can a site like turbo tax or tax act help me in this situation (would they allow me to file taxes for previous year) or am I better off going to a tax place like H&R block.

{"prompt":"This story took place two years ago, a couple of months after the bike incident I had with another girl. This girl was just a friend. Being the immature teenage boy I was, I teased this girl. I remember meeting her and talking to her for a little while at an Interact service (A community service club in my high school). After a week or two with us going about our lives, I was walking down the hallway and she just saw me holding my bag of chips and was like \"You owe me chips,\" as a friendly gesture.\n\nAgain, me being the immature guy I was, I played along with it. Whenever I saw her in the hallway, I would be like \"You owe me chips!\" and she would say \"No, you owe me chips wtf.\" One day after school, I started doing this in front of her friends and embarrassed her. She thought I was just being funny and enjoyed it. One day, I bought myself a couple bags of chips and I tried giving one to her, but she rejected. Although I was pretty persistant about giving it to her, she still said no. Now that I think about it, even though she said no playfully, I now know that she was getting pretty damn annoyed.\n\nThe next day during lunch time, I walked by her table and threw the bag onto her lap. I kid you not, this girl got up and started booking it to me with the intention of trying to give it back to me, so I went along with it and started a chase. After maybe like 50 feet, I hear a slam on the ground. I look back and I saw that she ate shit, in front of 70+ other people. Her three-week old phone cracked, elbow scrapped, knee bleeding. Yeah, it was a pretty bad fall.\n\nI walked her to the nurse's office, embarrassed as hell and expecting her to yell the shit out of me, but she didn't, thankfully. I helped her clean up her wounds, bandaged them, and apologized. Since then, she hasn't said a word to me and just ignored me when she saw me. I had no game in high school as you can tell by my previous posts.","chosen":"Girl tripped and ate shit as I tried running away from her as she tried to return me a bag of chips.

{"prompt":"Okay, so it's a little complicated. Here's some backstory:\n\nWe dated about two years ago, but things ended with a lot of hurt on both sides. It was a silly thing, a small argument that got out of hand because we were long distance and too young to know how to cope with that. I never really got over him, and a few months ago took the step of contacting him again. Since then, we've been talking and getting along very well. So here's the issue...\n\nI am still very much in love with him, and want nothing more than to be with him. He tells me he feels the same, but is unsure about taking it to the next level. We are still long distance (opposite ends of the UK), and I believe that he is scared that the same thing will happen again. I understand this, it was incredibly hard to handle, but we are different people now, more able to handle small disagreements like that. Yes, long distance is taxing, but if it's worth it...\n\nHe also seems to have very set ideas about what I will 'expect' from him. This is very frustrating for me, as these are his ideas and have no bearing on what I would actually need\/want in a potential relationship. He seems to misread all my well intentioned conversation as me distrusting him, wanting to know where he is and what he's doing 24 7, when in reality I am simply enquiring about his day. I am merely interested in him, naturally so considering my feelings.\n\nIt is a very difficult situation for us both. But I love him dearly, and want nothing more than a chance to show him that. It causes me great pain that he cannot see this, and I am honestly terrified that he will throw this away rather than risk the hurt. I think it could be something beautiful.","chosen":"I'm 22, he's 22. We dated for two years, but things ended badly.

I finally stopped thinking about anyone else other than my current girlfriend. However she forgot my birthday. I became upset and told her I was not ok with her just leaving me alone like that. She claimed she was tired and didn't want to do anything with me that day. I didn't speak to her for a few days I was so upset she completely ignored me. I confronted her about it. She said she doesn't want to fight and said this relationship is no longer what she wants. I was angry. \nI don't like it when someone to constantly say \"i love you\" then the next day throw you away like trash. I felt like trash.

He had a rough life growing up and not the greatest role models or guidance, so his coping skills occasionally include drinking, which really bugs me.

{"prompt":"**The Basics**\n\nMy girlfriend was just offered a job at one of the major tech firms in Seattle with a salary of $110,000+ bonuses. It's kind of a dream job for her and a significant bump in salary. \n\nWe currently live in New York. Still in separate apartments (which I think is a key thing to mention here). We've dated for about a year. I've known her for even longer.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI don't know if I want to move to Seattle. I feel like the decision was just thrown on me last night. And the challenge is - making this decision makes me think - am I going to marry this girl? Am I going to stay with her forever? Is she worth completely committing to?\n\nIt's not even the move that intimidates me. Seattle would be great. I'd love to do that. It's the commitment. It's the conversation of \"Of course I'll move with you cross country, drop my job and leave my friends.\" - I don't know if she's someone I should be with forever. To put it simply, I don't think I'm in love with her. I don't really know what that means, but I just know that I may want to date other people before I settle down.\n\nSo this opens the pandora's box of relationship issues. I started dating her casually, and it slowly evolved to be more serious, but in terms of marriage\/settling down I've always been explicit that I didn't want to do anything of the sort until my early 30's. This moving conversation opens up that discussion again.\n\nWe just had the conversation last night. She just left my apartment this morning and it's running around my mind.\n\n**The Question**\n\nWhat do you recommend I do?

He has no messages in his inbox, but you can delete those right? I haven't ever used the site.\n\nI didn't bring it up to him for a few days because I just didn't want to think about it.

{"prompt":"My best friend from high school, let's call him Harry, is really successful. Like, ridiculously so. Self-made multi-millionaire at 20 after starting his own business at 18 while also graduating from university 2 years early. We were rivals in a bunch of things at school, and it wasn't a problem, but had a big fight when I was rejected from my first-choice university after Harry also applied and got in with a very similar resume, even though he had no intention of going. We made up, and later he offered me a chance to join him in starting his business (part-time while studying), but I declined.\n\nIn hindsight, I think that not putting enough effort into university applications and not being willing to commit to the work associated with a start-up are two of the worst decisions I've made. I'm fairly high-achieving by most standards: have ended up at a top university anyway, getting good grades, currently working a well-paid internship, etc. Of course it's difficult not to be comparative, but by itself the fact that I'm jealous of Harry is something I think I can deal with. What's making it really problematic that his successes are closely correlated with my own biggest regrets. Since we're living in different countries right now, it takes some effort to Skype and stay in contact; but because of those associations and the emotional response I get when thinking about them, I'm increasingly hesitant to do so (he talks about his academic and corporate work a fair bit, since they're very big parts of his life right now), and have to focus on pushing down those feelings when we're talking.

Even if it's bad news, I just need to ease my mind because not knowing is stressing me the fuck out. \n\nI realize I probably sound crazy and too emotionally invested, but like I said, this doesn't happen often, and I just wish I could know if the feelings are mutual, because at this point I'm kind of assuming the worst (bad habit).\n\nI cannot stress enough that I don't care that she hasn't texted me back, people have lives, etc etc, I get it. but it just kinda worries me that it's a bad sign and I'm curious if the females reading this think not responding to a text for over 24 hours now is probably nothing, probably means something not-so-good, etc. \n\nIf I'm being fucking retarded and you think 24 hours is no big deal and you think she could still be really into me then just say so, you aren't gonna hurt my feelings.\n\nBasically need some kind of reassurance either way, because 7 years without this is a long time and this is stressing me the fuck out, lol.\n\nThank you for tolerating my shenanigans.","chosen":"Had amazing first date with girl, haven't heard from her in 24 hours.

{"prompt":"My gf and I have been dating for a year and a half, and are about to start trying the long distance thing because I have to move for work.  \n\nRecently she had to move into a new apartment, and I moved in with her as my current lease ends two months before I have to move.\n\nFor the past 6 weeks she has grown emotionally cold towards me, which she attributes to being too stressed with everything in her life.  I've been supportive and tried to hear her out, offer advice if asked, and try to make her happy still whenever the opportunity presents itself.  But the relationship has been growing colder from her end, and more than once she's told me she's been yelling at me just to hurt me and act out.  She is an only child and states that \"this is how I (she) am, I'm selfish and you should know that about me\".   She has flat out told me that my presence in the apartment now is distressing for her, and its starting to make me feel like I'm unwanted here.  \n\nThis is despite the fact that I have helped move her out of her old place on my own while she was too busy at work, sacrificed my own time on setting up her (our) new place, dealt with my own family members turning gravely sick (for which she hasn't even tried talking to me about despite me being obviously distressed about it) and have been  solely taking care of a new dog we got together.\n\nI know it sounds like I'm rambling, but I've talked with her a lot about these issues and been very direct about how I feel that she's taking her frustrations about her job\/personal responsibilities out on our relationship and on me....

My brother and sister both know and would be on my side. However if they said anything my mom would probably kick them out. If I said something my mom could make me go live with my dad. or even worse my mom could get divorced and move in with this new guy, who is a total cunt by the way.

{"prompt":"Hey folks,\n\nMy ex (we dated for just shy of 3 years) and I broke up about 6 months ago, and I was immature about it. Neither of us were happy in the relationship, but I told her I didn't want to be friendly going forward and basically never wanted to see or hear from her again. This is complicated by the fact that we live in the same neighborhood, went to college together and share some common acquaintances.\n\nEven though breaking up was very hard on me, I also stupidly followed through on a macho impulse to act as though it didn't particularly bother me at the time and, when she asked me how I was so calm, told her that it just felt better now that we had made a decision.\n\nSo, I think this adds up to me having been a jackass. And I really regret it because I have no end of respect for this woman. I've thought on and off about reaching out to apologize because it seems like the right thing to do, but I don't want to weird her out now 6 months out from breaking up.\n\n I have no desire to get back together with her, nor do I think she'd be interested in dating me again.

We had talked about me going, staying together for the process, and having him come over on a visa for the last two months to stay with me. Three months into my journey **HE** dumped **ME**. Not the other way around. This was a job opportunity trip that helped me in my field of profession. I didn't cheat on him nor did I talk\/sleep with someone after the break up.

{"prompt":"So there's this guy (lol). About a year ago I went to a party and met up with a guy (W) of whom I knew but reputation due to mutual friends and because he was in the same program as me at school. I almost hooked up with him, going so far as to go home with him but then I stopped it because I was in a relationship at the time (we didn't go further than a few fairly innocent kisses). I really liked him, like a lot, which drove me to break up with my boyfriend but at the time W was kind of pissed that I was with someone else and didn't want to entertain any more thoughts of a fling with me. However after this all went down he friended me on several social medias and we maintained a causal relationship. It's been a long while, and in the past year he graduated and moved back to our shared metro hometown. I'm home for break right now and I'd really like to reconnect with him but I don't know how to do it without being totally awkward even though the situation had totally changed. I've always had a crush on him and I would hate that this old boyfriend is holding us back, though I feel like it doesn't matter anymore and I would hope that I did the right thing before..

{"prompt":"When my girlfriend and I started dating 7 months ago, she mentioned she had a crazy stalker ex who was still crazy over her and would call\/text her once in a while although she said she wouldn't reciprocate. I didn't think much of it.\n\nThis past weekend she told me that this guy tried calling her saying he would try to break up our relationship. When I asked her the reasons why he would want to do that, she was not straightforward with me and I felt something was up.\n\nSo I found the number of the other guy and called him up. Surprisingly, he said years ago she used to be madly in love him and went pscyho trying to ruin his life and trying to break up his relationships. He also said that on the friday before the weekend, she texted him asking to give her and a friend a ride from the bar. Furthermore, he said that they do text each other in a while.\n\nWhen I confronted my girlfriend about all this, she confessed and said everything was true. But she said the only reason she talked to him was to keep tabs as he used to be a big part of her life. As for the reason for asking for a ride, she said she was just drunk with her friend and needed  a ride home (I don't have a car). \n\nShe said she didn't want to tell me about the truth because she didn't want me to get upset. But why did she lie and tell me he's a crazy stalker when in truth she was reciprocating? Also I was shocked she asked him for a ride while she was really drunk. She never told me any of this.\n\nIn all honesty, I don't think she had the intention of cheating, but I just think she doesn't want to let go of the past. She still says she loves me and would never want him over me, which I believe.\n\nWhat scares me most is how she lied about the whole situation. I feel like my trust for her has been severely violated and I don't know how to move forward. Is this something I should forgive? Or are these signs that she might do something like this in the future and I should get out while I can?","chosen":"Girlfriend lied about keeping in contact with ex while reciprocating.

{"prompt":"I've been seeing him since August of 2014. We spend the majority of our time together- he sleeps at my apartment, hangs out there most of the day while I'm at work (he's a bartender so we have opposing schedules), we do multiple date-like activities a week, etc. He'll go back to his apartment to shower and hang out with his roommate or just have some \"him time\", but I can't remember the last time he spent a night at his place.  \n\nAt any rate, we've been saying things like \"I like you\" and \"I really like you\" for about two months now. The other day he went home for a while; we were separated for *maybe* 6 hours before he came back saying he couldn't believe how much he missed me, and that 6 hours was too long to be apart. We're obviously in that stage of our relationship where we're crazy about each other.  \n\nThe other night he was being incredibly affectionate, telling me how much he likes me and how beautiful I am and so forth, and I ended up responding \"I love you\" at what felt like a completely organic time. He squeezed me in response and didn't say it back, which is completely fine. I know he cares about me, and some people move at different paces when it comes to using the word 'love'.  \n\nI just don't know how I should proceed. Should I keep saying \"I love you\" because that's how I feel, or switch back to \"I like you\" so he doesn't feel pressured? Would it be completely weird and unromantic to flat out ask him \"Hey, should I not say this anymore until you're ready?\" Any advice would be appreciated.

{"prompt":"Okay, so it's a little complicated so I'll try and keep it brief. I live with 4 guys in house and I have a major crush on one of them. When I first moved into the house, I had a boyfriend. After we broke up, my roommate *Drew* was the first person I told and he let me cry on him (he's a little OCD, and told me that I was the first person he ever let cry on him).\n\nAnyways, so time went on, and on Halloween, he took a picture with me and had both of his arms around me and came into my job and almost kissed me. He was also kind of tipsy though.\n\nSo then more time passes and we continued to bond. And it was one of the other roommate's 21st birthday party, so we all got really drunk and we were on the couch and I started to tickle him and we ended up cuddling in front of everyone for the rest of the night.\n\nBut then I felt like we were growing a little distant, so I started to put up a wall out of fear of getting hurt. When I confronted him about the void, he said that I was the one blocking him out, and that I put my headphones on before I even leave my room and I won't make eye contact with him, and that he likes it when I say hi to him. \n\nSo I'm getting really mixed feelings from him, and his friends said that he won't approach a woman-that they have to be aggressive with him.

{"prompt":"In the past 2 years, I've slowly lost at least 25 pounds. This is due mostly to casual exercise at my own pace, with fits of serious exercising. I also ate less due to my positive mental state. However, I have a history of depression and tend to eat when it's upon me.

I cried and she prescribed me phentermine. I know the stories about brutal side effects, but I'm willing to take it. I'm already planning on how to keep it off after I'm done taking the pill. But I'd really appreciate advice on this. I've got metamucil to ward off hunger, and plenty of very low calorie canned food to eat sparingly. I'm going to do myself pretty rough for at least a couple of months after quitting the drug to prevent the backslide everyone seems to have. But at what point can I chill out and not count every calorie and try to keep it around 1000 a day? I'd been slowly losing weight almost naturally before, when can I relax and not be afraid of gaining it all back like lightening? Also, ANY mental tactics to beat cravings during that time would be awesome.. and just advice in general.

{"prompt":"Okie dokie! So, pretty simple situation, I just need other peoples opinions. Been seeing this girl for a few months, nothing serious at the start and still nothing too serious as of yet. But as we all know, the more time you spend with someone, the closer you get. So we're certainly getting closer.\n\nAnyways, in a few months time me and quite a few friends have organized a fun little trip away and we have got quite a sizeable group coming along with us. Now the problem is, it was very much a 'invite all your friends along' type situation so we have friends of ours inviting other friends etcetc. Now, one of my friends has unknowingly invited someone whom I have slept with before, which is fine as we still get along just fine and never even mention what happened between us. However, the girl I am seeing is coming on the trip with us.\n\nSo the question is, do I tell her about my history with this other girl or not? There's literally nothing between myself and that other girl anymore, but of course its hard to tell as to whether the girl I'm seeing would rather know, or not know. For you girls out there, would you want me to tell you about this other girl before the trip, or would you prefer I just think nothing of it and hope to God it doesn't come up whilst we're all hanging out?\n\nIts not a big deal to me at all (the history), but it very well could be a big deal for the girl I'm seeing.

Then I thought I'd want to pursue a career in international relations or something like that, but I just didn't want to go into more debt with more school. About a year after I graduated, I started to work as a substitute teacher, so I figured I'd pursue teaching. While getting into an alt cert program, I started working at Ross (the store) in October of 2014. While at Ross, I had so much pressure on me to find a teaching job with health insurance. Fast-forward to August 2015, I finally got a teaching job! But that job was hell on earth. I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, so after two months, I had to quit. I went to a therapist (which I'm still seeing) and I'm doing much better, so now I have a job at Sears.\n\nI'm thankful for my job, but I'm 25 going to be 26 in May and I'm still living with my parents.

The only problem is that all the years before took such a financial toll on my mom. So the past years she's basically been struggling to even be there for us at all. About 2 years ago she lost the apartment that we were living in. I had to live with my bestfriend for the last months of Highschool. My mom and sister stayed with one of her friends from the area. After Highschool we all moved in with my mom's parents. It's a mess really. I don't like going into detail on the living situation, but let's just say its very messy. I really don't like living like this although I have for the past couple of years.\n\nI have a pretty nice job at a high end computer retailer and I'm looking to continue education for a better career.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend and I live in a managed apartment community, have lived here for about two years. We moved to this city in huge part because of the lower living expenses. When we moved in, we were told to expect increases of at least $25 on lease renewal, and last year the rent increased $27 which was *totally* reasonable. Currently we pay $936\/month for a 2\/2, which we split about 40\/60.\n\nThe other day I got a renewal offer in my email, the lowest priced option was $1051\/month, which is an increase of $115 a month and seems unreasonable.

For background, we are doing okay financially(0 debt, we each have at least a 6 month emergency fund, there's money left over to save each month but not a ton), but we are planning to get married soon and the extra $115 a month is money I had mentally put aside for modest rings and a short honeymoon. Add to that, we will have about $2k in additional expenses in November outside of our regular bills... so the idea of our rent going up after that stresses me out.\n\nMy question is this -- is there anything we can do about this?

{"prompt":"So today I finally pieced together the reasons for why my past relationship broke down.\n\nAt first I thought it was because of something I did(or didn't do) and I was beating myself senseless right after the break-up trying to find out what I did wrong and fix it (purely as a self-improvement thing). \n\nWell today I was looking through my chat logs(an old habit) and realized that the warning signs were sown long ago. \n \nI.) Several messages at odd times of the Night of her asking if I will get angry if she hugged her Ex. (Future note: receiving this message should have clued me in, but I was so infatuated at the time I didn't really put too much weight on it.\n\nII.)Frequent Movie visits to movies I had invited her to watch with her \"Brother\", and several visits with her \"girlfriends\" towards the end of the relationship. Which she flat out denied me from even visiting after (for lunch, FroYo and the like)\n\nIII.) Limiting eye contact and constant denial and (soft) refusal to spend time. Tons of excuses such as \"needing to take care of the nephews\", and having a family movie night... EVERY SINGLE TIME I planned something for us to do. To the point that she can't even reserve a weekend for us 4 weeks in advance(Vegas Trip).\n\nIV.)Finding from one of her friends that she was infatuated with her Ex-BF for a year after the breakup, which ended around the same time I start dating her.\n\nI used to feel like I was in the wrong. As if the whole blowout were due to my faults... as if I said something or did something so incredibly bad as to change someone's opinion of me overnight.... but today's revelations taught me that no matter how smart a girl is... she doesn't necessarily know what the hell she wants half the time.","chosen":"Finally pieced together why my past relationship broke down and it changed my entire view of her.

About a year ago I went to a party and met up with a guy (W) of whom I knew but reputation due to mutual friends and because he was in the same program as me at school. I almost hooked up with him, going so far as to go home with him but then I stopped it because I was in a relationship at the time (we didn't go further than a few fairly innocent kisses). I really liked him, like a lot, which drove me to break up with my boyfriend but at the time W was kind of pissed that I was with someone else and didn't want to entertain any more thoughts of a fling with me. However after this all went down he friended me on several social medias and we maintained a causal relationship. It's been a long while, and in the past year he graduated and moved back to our shared metro hometown. I'm home for break right now and I'd really like to reconnect with him but I don't know how to do it without being totally awkward even though the situation had totally changed.

{"prompt":"My family has tried literally EVERYTHING to control the fleas in our neighborhood (Frontline, Advantage, Diatomaceous Earth, Dawn Dishsoap, etc!) and nothing has worked.

The only thing that has worked so far is Comfortis, but I've read of several dogs having reactions to it that can be pretty severe. My dogs are fine, we've used it for about a year now, but I don't like the idea of harming them or putting them at risk. \n\nGiving them baths with blue Dawn dish soap does kill all the fleas, but it does nothing to prevent more from coming back, obviously.

Over the course of the 6 months we've been together I have made it clear how the smoking bothers me, but it does not seem to phase him and he seems set in his ways. He just has excuses and hasn't made mention of trying to quit smoking. So, I broke up with him last night and he seems perfectly OK with that regardless of the amazing connection we had.

I need some validation here, because I kind of feel like a dirt bag for not being able to accept him for this flaw but at the same time I feel fleeced that he knew very well he was a hard core smoker with crappy lifestyle habbits and just wanted to put on the facade that he was a person I could be with.","chosen":"I left my boyfriend because he smokes.

I know that a class of 500 students is not a huge sample size, but when my brother was a senior five years ago he was probably the fifth to tenth tallest person in his class at 6'6\".

Yes 6'8\" is tall but I've gone to school with him for many years and know that both of his grandfathers are over 7'0 tall, his father is over 7'0 tall, and his mother is 6'8\". He suspects that he is done growing since he's been the same height since freshman year- so this 6'8\" seems short for his genetics (note that I know nothing about genetics past punnet squares). I also realize that five years is not nearly long enough time for such a drastic change to be taking effect, and that this may just be all coincidental. Now, I look back at my parents' yearbooks and see kids with full beards, at my school it is common to sport a beard if you're able to grow one (ie my hideous chinstrap). There are only a few kids with more than peach fuzz it seems. I'm not trying to be \"lol I'm so manly and everyone else is prepubescent\" (my noodle arms would like to disagree)- I feel like if I were placed in high school ten years ago that I would look like a completely average senior, and yet people tell me I look like I'm 25.","chosen":"Are people getting smaller and maturing at a later age or is it the same as it has always been and I just feel that way because of how I perceived older kids while I was a younger kid?","rejected":"My classmates are not getting any taller, I'm wondering if this is a new trend or if it's just the same as it's always been."}

There have been a few ups and downs in our relationship- mainly I have an issue with him drinking and cheating on me in the past (it happened twice). He had a rough life growing up and not the greatest role models or guidance, so his coping skills occasionally include drinking, which really bugs me. I encouraged him to seek counseling instead of drinking and he did for a while, but then stopped. Also the cheating was very early on in the relationship and then once last year. He was extremely tearful and apologetic, so I (maybe naively?) forgave him.\n\nSo, fast forward to now. Things have been really great or so I've thought.

{"prompt":"My GF and I have been dating for four years. About a month ago, I proposed, and she accepted. Marriage was something we had been talking about for months.

Very well-off. It's obvious just from their lifestyle, and the way the support their only daughter. I have a good relationship with them. I think (thought?) they liked me we we met.\n\nMy GF told her parents immediately after the proposal and everything was great. They expressed their happiness, and actually flew down the following day. Nothing about a pre-nup was mentioned to me or her.\n\nThen, yesterday, my GF told me that her father called her and asked her if she was getting a pre-nup. She told him no, and apparently they got into an argument. My GF later told me what happened, and told me that he \"demanded\" she get a pre-nup and threatened to cut her off if she didn't. Her feeling right now is that she is mad at them and she isn't going to fold to their demand. \n\nI have a lot of problems with this.

{"prompt":"First of all, i got into a car accident like 4 months ago while my sister's friend (lets call her Kim) was in the passenger sit. I made a U-turn and while i saw car was coming but i guess i was wrong and i got hit from the back while about to get into my lane. My car was totaled after sniping out of control and Kim (I must say, i think she's a total brat and i highly dislike her but my sister begged me to take her to her house, so i did) ended up in the hospital to get stitches in her head. I felt fucked up as well but i was too scared and too busy panicking to think about anything else. The police report said that it was neutral fault. Well here's the thing i don't understand. Kim ended with a check of 10,000 to pay for her hospital bills while i ended up having to buy another car at my expense and my insurance went up. They gave her a check and i'm pretty sure she wasted all the money already without paying the hospital bill yet. Why does it work like that?","chosen":"Got in a car accident, my passenger ended with a check of 10,000 to pay for her hospital bills while i ended up having to buy another car at my expense and my insurance went up.","rejected":"Sister's friend in accident got check for 10k but wasted most of it before paying for hospital bills, not sure why it works like that."}

As soon as I moved in sooo many red flags popped up, found out he had lied about his age, he would just flip shit over little things, constantly needed to know where I was, constantly called me stupid and a bitch. Now I realized I had made a mistake but I had enrolled in a semester and just began working and so I was stuck (manipulation was also a factor in me not getting the fuck out). A few months down the line thing actually start getting better, living together is working out until his landlord demands I leave by the end of November. Not knowing anyone in the city made finding a place very hard and expensive and he wanted to get a place together so I complied. Of course the abuse came back full force as soon as we moved.

{"prompt":"Okay so I didn't really get both my front teeth but I couldn't pass up the title and as most TIFU post begin, mine too starts with a little backstory. I'll try to be quick.\n\nSo in the 6th grade I was on my way to school on my bike just as I would do any other day. Suddenly, and I shit you not, some jackass I had never met decided to kick me off of my bike. I wasn't expecting this and so when he kicked the peg of my bike I swerved too hard and as my front tire went perpendicular I flew off the bike, and onto the pavement, teeth first. Luckily my teeth only had some cracks in them and they really weren't noticeable. My lip on the other hand was split wide open but that part isn't important to the post.\n\nSo here I am about a week ago at my friends house having a few beers and taking shots while playing a Mario kart drinking game when some more people show up so we're gonna go to Gamestop to get more controllers. (Sober driver drove, obviously) While walking out of his room my friend looks up and blows on the plastic piece of those pull strings that you use to let down the foldable attic stairs, you know what I mean. (I added a photo of the one in my house but it doesn't have the plastic piece) In any case it shoots up the string and makes it quite high and so I, in my infinite tipsy wisdom decided to beat his \"record\". Now I'm shorter than my friend by a few inches and I know there's no way I'll beat his \"record\" if my breath dissipates before it reaches the plastic handle thing. Naturally this prompts me to jump a bit off the ground so as to compensate for the height difference. I hop, I push with my breath, I only get the plastic piece a few inches up the string. This is followed by me closing my mouth on the way down from the hop and the plastic piece hooking on the back of my tooth and shattering it. The next day I went to the dentist and had my tooth bonded. My mother said it was a Christmas gift.","chosen":"TIFU by getting my two front teeth for Christmas.

This was actually the first time I had made out with anyone, so it was pretty special. On Monday, we talked about it and she told me she had never been with someone who was so passionate and caring, which was great. We even made plans for this coming Sunday to see a movie together. \n\nThen, yesterday, she asked me a lot of questions, starting with stuff like \"What type of women are you in to?\" and \"What turns you on\", then it started changing into \"What do you want to do when you graduate\" and \"How many children do you want?\" I answered all her questions and we talked for a long time about each of them, and I even asked her them back. I didn't really think much of it until she asked me to go to San Francisco with her instead of seeing a movie nearby. This is the moment I realized that maybe she thought we were farther along into a relationship than I did.

{"prompt":"Hello World!\n\nI have been around reddit for a while now (I lurked for a time, judge if you must), so I feel that I have a general understanding of how the hive-mind of reddit works.

He is not a complete imbecile and rightfully finds this to be disturbing, as I do.  He then looked to the left and found that, at the time, the post had gotten 1919 upvotes.

There are a couple issues: first, the physical distance between us and, second, her disproportionate feelings toward me. \n\nHer parents live about 20 minutes away from me so the distance wasn't a big deal for our first couple of dates. However, she is an undergraduate in a college that is 2.5 hours away from the city that I live\/grad school that I attend. I've gone up and spent the weekend at her place, and she recently came down and split time with her family and me. \n\nThat's when we had a conversation, and we agreed to be exclusive. We agreed to take turns seeing each other every 2 weeks or so. We text and skype quite often to compensate for the lack of personal interaction. \n\nIt's obvious to me that she has intense feelings toward me, but I just don't feel such mad \"love.\" Example: I barely use facebook except for the chat function, but she just litters my wall with stuff.

{"prompt":"Background:\nI'm 21(F) and he's 25. He moved in with his old college room mates about a year ago, and they're a terrible influence on him. Before he moved in there, he used to go to the gym regularly, eat well, and go to church. Since he's moved in with them, he's gained about 30 lbs. To be fair, I've gained weight as well since we started dating, but it's mostly because I started at a University with a meal plan, and later on I could only afford cheap, less-healthy food. I've been trying to work with him constantly for both of us to go to the gym more, eat better, and go to church together.  He ends up going out to eat way more than he should (his friends all have good paying jobs and don't really care about their health, while he's still looking for a job in his field of study), and is just generally negatively affected by the environment. I like the person he is when we're alone a lot better than him around his guy friends. It seems like he just makes a lot of poor choices around this group. I don't know how to go about telling him this...I know guys can be sensitive when it comes to their friends, though he already knows I don't like his friends. They give me a hard time a lot and tend to make me feel like crap- they've actually reduced me to tears a few times. On that note- they're about 70\/30 as far as being jerks goes.

It was a really awkward story.\n\n \nWhen the girl came out, I ordered a drink and she didn't even bring it to me. It peeved me a little, and when we ended up leaving, she apologized to me then pulled my boyfriend aside to give him her e-mail address so they could catch up. This girl is very attractive and the situation is making me a bit uncomfortable. They're such distant friends, he didn't even have her on Facebook. When we got home, he promptly added her and proceeded to creep her profile. \n\nI'm not sure if I should be uncomfortable with this or not. Any advice on how to handle this would be really appreciated. Thanks.","chosen":"My boyfriend got an e-mail from a waitress at a restaurant where he went out to dinner with his family.

{"prompt":"Would love to hear from others in similar situations. I've been with my bf for about 4 years now and we're pretty much in it for the long haul. Neither of us are marriage people, but we're basically in that stage of our relationship, to give you an idea. We've lived together for most of our relationship and we've grown very comfortable with each other, which is great. \n\nNow, we're kind of drifting into that territory where the sex has decreased a lot. It went from 4-5 times a week to maybe once every 2-3 weeks. It's been a gradual fade so it's not shocking or anything. And it's not for lack of attraction; we're both quite affectionate otherwise and are still attracted to each other. But it does seem strange how little it bothers me that we don't really do it anymore. And he doesn't seem to mind either; he's quite outspoken and open about his emotions so it definitely would have come up a while ago if it had been bothering him. I guess my only concern is is this going to be detrimental to our relationship eventually? I've read about dead bedrooms and people becoming frustrated and resentful over not getting the amount of sex they want... But I don't think it's affected us at all. My sister told me that she and her husband of 9 years started scheduling sex after they had their second kid because otherwise it would happen way less, but that sounds really unappealing to me. Like a doctor's appointment or something. I think if it's going to happen it should happen organically... But what do I know. I'm pretty young and inexperienced with all this.

That night went fantastic, we hit it off immediately, got a kiss goodnight, everything was looking up. We go on a few dates, walk in the park, dinner and a movie, etc and things continue to look up. The one problem we continued to have was not really communicating, we would not talk\/sparsely talk for a week or more between dates, it seemed like we just didn't have a lot to talk about. We had sex, the sex was great, we both left extremely satisfied. But despite that, and the fun we had on dates, we continued to not really talk.

{"prompt":"I'm a staunch supporter of the 2nd Amendment. I believe citizens have both the constitutional and the natural right to bear any small arms they choose - including assault rifles, machine guns, and even should-fired missiles. I support thorough background checks on weapons purchases, as well as state-issued firearm licenses. However, I don't think people should have to pay special fees or taxes on specified weapons types (for example, the current NFA tax on short-barreled rifles). In short, I advocate firearms being freely available with minimal government regulation.\n\nThe common arguments against gun control involve hunting, recreational shooting, and home defense. I whole-heartedly support those things, but I think focusing on them too much ignores the primary reason for an armed civilian population: PROTECTION FROM TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENT.\n\nWhen writing the 2nd Amendment, the Founding Fathers specifically had armed militias in mind. Such militias played a pivotal role against the British during the American Revolution, and it was assumed that they could play a role in keeping any future government in check.\n\nToday, the media regularly tells us about police brutality and CIA torture. It is now \"legal\" for the federal government to spy on, kidnap, indefinitely detain, and assassinate anyone (including American citizens) it deems a \"threat\" to itself. I don't care what Congress or the Supreme Court says- these things are wrong, and they threaten the freedom of the American people! \n\nIn order to maintain a free, safe, democratic nation, PEOPLE SHOULD NOT FEAR THEIR GOVERNMENT! THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD FEAR THEM!","chosen":"I support the 2nd Amendment, but I also support the idea that the government should not be allowed to take away our rights.","rejected":"I support the 2nd Amendment, but I think the government should be strictly limited in its ability to regulate the ownership and use of firearms.

{"prompt":"When I was young- 1st grade, maybe even before, I was tested for my IQ. I remember how my parents used to be so proud to tell me that the doctor said I had a higher IQ than even his. I don't remember the exact number but I know it was in the upper 140s, likely 146. During most of grade school, I felt as if I was that intelligent. However, during my final year at high school and my years so far in college, I haven't felt so smart. My mind feels sluggish at times and it doesn't seem to react with the same speed it used to. It's like a hazy feeling that I should be able to think through a problem that's giving me issues and it takes a lot more effort than I'm used to. I don't know what to think of this but I try to brush it off as simply being out of practice with the subjects I'm thinking about. I don't know if this is really it though. I don't do many harmful activities- I only drink sparingly and I don't do drugs. I exercise daily and eat healthily. The only thing I really do is play a very very large amount of video games and be on my computer for hours. I saw a comment on another thread and it made me think about this again. So, what is my problem? Is there anything I can do to regain my sharpness and should I start cutting out my excessive hours of video games?","chosen":"was tested for high IQ when young, feel smarter now than ever but lately feel mentally slow and hazy. suspect excessive video gaming may be causing this. what should I do?","rejected":"I was told I was super smart and I always used to feel that way but for quite some time I don't, so is my excessive computer playing to blame?"}
{"prompt":"Hey Reddit,\n\nMy SO [25F] and I [30M] are great about 95% of the time. Sometimes she does little things that bug me and I'll let her know that they bug me on the spot and she'll recognize what she did, apologize, and correct her actions. She's just as communicative with me when I annoy her with my stupid antics and I'll apologize and correct whatever it is that needed correcting.\n\nHowever, the bigger issues like money, marriage, sex and overall feelings tend to be \"sit down\" conversations. When she brings up an important issue, I listen intently, take a moment to process and build a proper response then tell her how I feel and together we come up with a course of action. \n\nOn the opposite side of the table, if I bring up an issue with her she completely shuts down. She doesn't speak, doesn't look at me, nothing. I think she's doing everything she can to hold tears back. I've told myself that I'd write a letter in the future expressing everything I felt but the conversations aren't exactly planned. I've even tried to wait it out and we both sat there for *10 minutes* in silence. Not joking. Literally 10 minutes because I told myself after 10 minutes I'd say something.\n\nWe've never yelled at each other and I love her dearly. I'm hoping there's a method or some kind of way that she'd be much more reciprocating during an important conversation. I certainly don't want to have an important conversation about how she's non-responsive during important conversations.","chosen":"SO is super responsive and communicative with me when I'm annoy her, however when it comes to serious issues there's usually silence and a shut down.

{"prompt":"I have been with my bf for 5 years now. We have had a somewhat rocky relationship because of distressing situations outside of the relationship (loss of loved ones, job relocation, etc.). However, we are deeply committed to each other. I have no issues with him looking at porn\/masturbating. Several times he has confessed to talking to women online, but usually not longer than a week and has no intentions of meeting them in real life. Is this just considered an extension of male fantasies? Like maybe getting turned on because someone else desires him?\n\nI should also mention that he is beyond social awkward. He has almost no friends in reality (and has lost contact with most of the ones he had) and spends a lot of time playing online and console games. It took him half a year to make friends with the people he works with, and he still hasn't socialized with them outside of work.\n\nOh, and the ladies he chats with are not necessarily the most attractive women. They are average to even plain-looking. Part of me thinks he chooses these women because he knows he stands a better chance of them replying to his messages.\n\nWe have discussed most of this before.

{"prompt":"The other day I met a woman who is about my age(18-19) and we instantly clicked with each other, I found out something that she liked and we spoke about that for a good amount of time. It turned out that she was taking a language course of a language that I speak fairly well, and she said something along the lines of \"you should help me because I have a test soon\". I got her phone number and sent her a text message a few hours later on in the day, sometime around 8:30 PM or so. The conversation is going nicely, she suddenly starts speaking in the language and things were going well. I decided to ask her (in the language) if she has free time the next day and that I can help her if she has some time. Now I haven't received a response since ~4 days, her Test has already passed. I thought that she was probably busy, but I remembered that she told me that she is sometimes socially anxious, so I think it could be her being too shy or something. The message mightve also been a bit difficult for her to understand, but I don't know. I don't think she is \"over\" me, since she seemed very nice and we had a good discussion earlier. My friend who was there for part of the time even told me that he thought she probably liked me(the way she looked at me, was interested as we spoke, etc) and she seemed happy in the texts(used some smiley faces, and was nice)\n\nSo now I am thinking about sending her a text today or tomorrow, asking how the test went, because I really enjoyed talking to her and want to get to know her better.

We have been doing everything together including 3 day camping trips, cooking dinner for each other, and other various activities.\n\nOf course when I think that I found the perfect girl there has to be a problem.  This one started when we first started seeing each other and she said that she wanted to take it slow as far as waiting to have sex (that's fine).

This is where it all began.\n\nSo I throw the toast into the toaster oven, set it to that perfect golden brown setting, and head into the bathroom to brush my teeth. As I come back into the kitchen there is smoke (not a lot but more than bread should let out) filling my kitchen and I think 'How the hell did I burn the toast I wasn't gone for that long' so I head over to the toaster and as I open it, some smoke billows out but my bread is maybe halfway done toasting. I figure it could have maybe been some food me and my girlfriend had cooked the night before that was dried and burned on the element.\n\nSo without thinking too much about it I throw some butter on it and a few pieces of asiago and fold it up in hopes the heat will melt both. As I start driving I take a bite and it tastes awful. It tastes like smoke (which isn't too bad) but there is something else - some bitter, horrible taste. I eat the piece because I was hungry dammit! So then I go for a second bite and I couldn't do it, as much as I needed to eat i just couldn't.

I have two reasons for this, one is that they can provide protection and the second is that they can be role models for kids that might not have one.

Another thing that gets overlooked is how much of a need there is for police outreach to kids in America and a police officer can do just that.

{"prompt":"Not quite sure where to start but here it goes. I just graduated and got a decent job paying over 40k in an IT field right out of school; currently working for the City my university is in. Due to my parents making to much money and sinking the left over money they did have into a currently profitable business they started, I was left to pay for college on my own. My parents also made to much money during my schooling time for me to get any lower interest federal loans; because of how naive and stupid I was I decided that private student loans through Sallie Mae would be a good alternative, big fucking mistake.

Long story short my monthly payments will be well over half my monthly income roughly ~$1,200 a month. I have looked into extended repayment and interest only payments for the loans but that would only cut the monthly bill by ~$300 and in turn making my $94,000 turn into a fat $300,000 bill over 25 years; some of the loans have interest rates as high as 14%. With all of my bills (Rent, car, insurance, gas, food) I will be completely broke. I have looked into going through a few local credit unions to see if I can refinance  with the help of having both my parents co-sign but none of them will loan me that kind of money. So I ask you Reddit in all your infinite wisdom to brain storm with me on other possible ways I can go about paying this back. I am starting to get some serious anxiety from this and right now its killing my relationship with my long term girlfriend. I am in desperate need of some help, guidance, and anything else that will make me feel any better about this.

It is also the longest relationship I have ever been in.\nI met my boyfriend at college which is out-of-state and during the summer we are in different states. I am in my home town where my ex lives.\nWhenever I'm driving around I find myself peering at all of the places he usually is, looking for a glimpse of his car or of him even.  I'm not entirely sure \/why\/ I do this.\n\nI had dated my ex for four months, the longest relationship I had ever had until my current one.  At the time I was certain he was the first person I ever fell in love with, but now that I've been in my current relationship I'm not even sure if I ever was \/in love\/ with him and not just infatuated.  He ended things with me and then proceeded to ignore me if he saw me in person for the next few days, blocked me on FB, etc.  I haven't really seen him since, I mean once I walked into the coffee shop he works at and saw him unexpectedly and turned right around and left without even getting farther than the doorway.\n\nI am just kind of confused. I don't know why I still feel weird and act weird about my ex when I am so in love and so happy with my much longer term boyfriend.\n\nDoes anyone else have experience with this?

I broke it off with her because of various personality problems that aren't relevant to this story.\n\nSince the breakup, she's posted Facebook updates every few days that are barbed, backhanded insults. We were poly (well, she was; I never dated outside of the relationship), and she'll post updates about how great her current partner is, especially compared to \"some of her exes,\" and referring to details of our relationship that I'm sure to get. I'm sure you've seen this sort of behavior, someone talking about how great things are now compared to *before,* how great it is to be finally understood, etc.\n\nSo I know it would be trouble to engage with this; it's probably what she wants. I've unsubscribed, so I can only see her updates when I look for them, which I do out of morbid curiosity every three or four days. Most of the time, they just cement my convictions about making the right choice in leaving her. Others, it makes me feel crappy, because sometimes the things she says have a grain of truth. There's a part of me that thinks not blocking her is a point of pride; I'm showing that I don't care. Another part of me thinks it might make me feel better to block her. And another, more vindictive, side hopes she'll see that she's been blocked and realize how crappy she is.","chosen":"To block the ex on Facebook or not?","rejected":"I broke up with my girlfriend because of her recent Facebook updates.

That was that. \n\nFast forward to August, and I notice a payment on my credit card to Netflix for about 8 bucks in July, one month after clearly canceling the free trial. I called them and was reassured that there was some sort of clerical error, and that the matter would be resolved in the next few days. The guy on the phone said I would be contacted with a resolution to the monthly charge, and promised me that I would see no further charges. The only contact I had since was an email asking me to re-open my account, which I obviously didn't want to do. I never did hear about a refund, but life being busy and all I just let it slide.\n\nFast forward again to today when I see yet another Netflix charge on my credit card for August. Another (angrier) phone call and this time was refunded the charge from July on the spot (so she said, have yet to verify) and told that they have no record of me being charged in August. Despite my explaining that I had the bill *in my hand*, she had nothing on her end. I was once again reassured that my account was closed.\n\nI ended up calling my credit card people to get refunded the payment in August, and to prevent any further charges from Netflix.

Recently he's been hinted that he's like to take me out on a date sometime, which I would really like, but I'm afraid he wouldn't be able to see past our differences if he knew how different we really were.\n\nNow, he really doesn't know much about my opinions on things because I'm a little quiet, he however is constantly posting his opinions on facebook, so I know them all too well.\n\nI guess the biggest difference it religion. He's catholic and it's a huge part of his life. I've been an atheist since I was about 14. Now for me personally this isn't a huge deal. My last boyfriend was religious, and we simply avoided the subject, but I'm thinking that this guy is just a little too... uh... devoted to just brush it off.\n\nHe's also constantly going on about being pro life and anti gay marriage. He's started several 100+ comment flame wars by being so forward with his opinions. I'm very pro choice, and my believe that everyone deserves to be happy in regards to love.

{"prompt":"Hey, first time post on here and I'm unsure how to handle myself.\n\nAbout last October (in 2013) I broke up with my long time girlfriend. We dated for about 6 years, throughout most of high school and a large portion of college. She was the first girl I dated and I really did care for her. I broke up with her because we were both abusive towards each other, physically (nothing extremely drastic but I have a scar on my arm because of her) and verbally.\n\nWe decided to stay friends after the break up and all seemed to be going well. However, I noticed that almost immediately (within like 2 weeks) after we broke up this guy she met from a club started hitting on her. She claims to have no attraction towards him but anyone with a pair of eyes can see there's a mutual attraction. Now I don't like this guy because he was hitting on her while we were still dating. I just got onto Facebook today to see her and a picture of him together celebrating his 21st birthday.\n\nI know I'm the one that broke it off and it's my fault for doing so, but I can't help but feel...betrayed? Is that normal? How should I handle myself? I feel like I want to punch something, as I still find myself caring for her, but that would only break my hand. I'm at a loss as to what to think\/feel and I don't have anyone else around I can talk to about this.

{"prompt":"I've been in a long distance relationship with this guy since October of last year. He lives 6 hours away and we've visited each other only three times, but we communicate frequently via text, phone, email, and (occasionally) written letters. When we first met I fell SO HARD for him. He was a 99% match on OKcupid and on paper he seemed like a perfect mate for me, so even though I had thought I was forever done with LDRs I figured I would give it a try. He has been nothing short of super sweet and patient with me always, which I have never experienced before, and he has surprised me numerous times with some truly beautiful and touching hand-made gifts.\n\nHowever, since our last visit I've had this feeling that we're just not right for each other in the long run. We have differing opinions about how quickly we want to move forward and whether or not to someday have kids, and there is a palpable lack of chemistry; dates with him involve SO. MUCH. AWKWARD. SILENCE. It is killing me that this wonderful guy just isn't right for me. I wish I could be as giving and loving to him as he has been to me, but it just feels weird and I know I have to break it off.\n\nThe problem is, we are supposed to go away for what was going to be a \"romantic weekend\"... I recently told him that I was having uncertainties about the relationship and that I wanted to talk to him about it in person. He said sure, good idea. So, it's really going to be a \"we need to talk\" weekend :-\/  \n\nI guess this is the kind of thing I have to play by ear, but I would love some guidance re: how to approach this situation. I hate the thought of him driving 3 hours to meet me at a hotel, only for me to say that maybe we shouldn't stay together, but I would feel worse saying it over the phone or through some other means of communication. I guess my real question is, how can I make this break-up as non-shitty for him as possible?","chosen":"My boyfriend is an amazing guy who has been patient and loving, but I just don't feel it, and we are supposed to spend a romantic weekend together this weekend.","rejected":"Really awesome guy, but in a LDR.

Anyway, I went to the pub with a few new friends last night and we all got very drunk and had a good time. We went back to a friends house where I ended up falling asleep. The problem: I went to bed alone (he has a spare bedroom which he let me use because I lived half an hour away from him) but in the middle of the night I woke up being in between two of my male friends. We were fully clothed so I just assumed they would rather share a bed than just sleep on the floor, which didn't bother me, but the friend behind me was touching me in very private places (he didn't go under clothing though). I could hear him whispering things to himself and it was very obvious he was horny. I felt very uncomfortable about this and panicked so I pretended that I was still sleeping.

{"prompt":"I suppose everyone will wonder how I'm able to view these texts. I'm not spying on him, (well, in a sense I'm not). My father and I have iPhones, and he logged into iMessage on my phone, and I guess that if he uses iMessage on his phone, if I'm logged into his account on my phone, I get all of his conversations. \n\nNow to the juicy part, for a lack of better terms. Over the past few days, I have read conversations of his to random number such as, and I quote, \"Wife is out of town. Wanna meet up? Name a price per hour.\" and also - \"Want to meet up? Missing you :( \". \n\nWhat scares me most about this is how sincere he sounds in the texts. Almost as if they have a semi-strong relationship, or as if they're somewhat dependent on each other.

I don't have a close enough relationship with my parents where I feel I could talk to either of them about this. \n\nI also don't believe that I have a right to be reading theses conversations, whether he's my father or not. I was considering just logging out, and deleting all the conversations, but I'm not sure.

Today is a great example. We both had a long day at work, plus we didn't really sleep well last night because of the heat... So we were just IMing about what we would do tonight, he said he wanted to stay home so I suggested I'd come over. Just to watch a movie or something. The last time we did this, he said two or three times \"Why don't we do this every night?\" But, he said he just wanted to relax, plan his holiday and pursue his hobby (Sorry if that's not the right expression, English is my second language).\n\nThis would be fine if this was the first time it happened, but it's not.

Rejection sucks. \n\nThe thing is, I don't know if I should bring it up. He's normally an amazing boyfriend, treats me way better than the guys I dated before him, constantly says he loves me and I feel I'd be unfair to make this allegation when he's so great in every other way.

The mutual friend is also thinking about having a birthday party in September and ex would be there. I hadn't thought about reaching out to ex in a long time, and am fine with us not talking.

{"prompt":"Background info: I'm 24 (almost 25), I graduated from college in 2008.  I make a decent amount of money at my job; enough that after a couple years of living at my parents' I was able to but myself a house and a nice car.  \n\nSo a few days ago a friend asks if I want to see a movie tonight with him and another friend.  They both work at the theater and are able to get a guest in free.  So I'm assuming I'll be going for free.  Today I ask him about it and tells me that he invited another friend and her boyfriend (and claims he invited them first) so they get the free tickets.  Mind you I don't think he even asked our other friend if it was cool if they used his guest pass.\n\nThis kind of bugged me so I said something to him about and he responds with something along the lines of \"well they probably won't go if they can't get in free.  No offense, but they don't have a lot of money and I feel like you can afford it.\"  He also said something about how he wouldn't be going either if he didn't work there because he doesn't have any money either.  I won't even get into that one, but let's just say he has another job as well and the only reason he's broke is because he spends frivolously on stupid shit.  I kind of just let it go after that.\n\nIt is true that I have more money than the rest of them, but between college loans, car payments, and a mortgage, I'm probably more in debt than the 4 of them combined.  \n\nTo me it would make more sense if we all (or at least the 3 guests) to split the cost of one ticket... The funny thing is that if I had been offered the guest pass I probably would have offered it to one of the other two anyway.

I'm an avid weight lifter, have a good career ahead of me, and am now beginning to dive into the world of classy fashion (goal this year is to get a bespoke suit).

For some reason whenever I am conversing with someone my mind switches into problem solving mode or I start telling a story that will somehow make it seem like I relate to them.  Whatever they are talking about my mind starts clunking away at it and then I spurt out a logical solution.  This works great if they are seeking my advice (so I'm awesome at the workplace) but it's absolutely terrible when say a pretty lady or a friend is sharing some intimate details with me and I can't keep my trap shut long enough to let them adequately tell the story so we can make a connection of some sort.\n\nRight now I'm slowly (very slowly) getting better at biting my tongue when talking to the opposite sex and also realizing that most people don't want their problems solved, they just want to talk and for you to understand.\n\nSo my question to you ladies and gentlemen is, what tips can you give me on becoming a better listener?

{"prompt":"Background:\nI'm 21(F) and he's 25. He moved in with his old college room mates about a year ago, and they're a terrible influence on him. Before he moved in there, he used to go to the gym regularly, eat well, and go to church. Since he's moved in with them, he's gained about 30 lbs. To be fair, I've gained weight as well since we started dating, but it's mostly because I started at a University with a meal plan, and later on I could only afford cheap, less-healthy food. I've been trying to work with him constantly for both of us to go to the gym more, eat better, and go to church together.  He ends up going out to eat way more than he should (his friends all have good paying jobs and don't really care about their health, while he's still looking for a job in his field of study), and is just generally negatively affected by the environment. I like the person he is when we're alone a lot better than him around his guy friends. It seems like he just makes a lot of poor choices around this group. I don't know how to go about telling him this...I know guys can be sensitive when it comes to their friends, though he already knows I don't like his friends. They give me a hard time a lot and tend to make me feel like crap- they've actually reduced me to tears a few times. On that note- they're about 70\/30 as far as being jerks goes. Maybe 1\/3 of the time they're actually decent to me, but I mostly end up feeling belittled and uncomfortable- it's a lot like High School. I've talked to him about this multiple times, and he says that A) I need to stand up for myself, and B) I need to let him know when I get upset, because he genuinely doesn't know what's making me upset, or what they say that sets me off. So, suggestions for how to bring this up with him?","chosen":"Boyfriend's friends are a bunch of assholes and it's starting to effect him negatively, how do I tell him and\/or let him know how upset I am without hurting his feelings?","rejected":"I'm 21, bf 25.

{"prompt":"background : I have been dating Sarah for almost 4 years now, since the start of university. We have had some conflicts in the past, but I still have feelings for her.\n\nI met someone(Rose) this past month. Someone who makes me feel happy like I haven't in a long time. I had begun to think that I was alone in how different I was from other people, but the scariest thing happened to first time we actually talked - EVERYTHING that she said just resonated wholeheartedly with me. It was like the world had created a copy of myself, a perfect match for me to find happiness. She makes me want to be social if only to spend time with her, which is a huge thing for me since I am so introverted.\n\nBut do I deserve it? I have been nothing but an asshole to Sarah lately, even though she has done everything to try to make things better or even accept my terrible faults. Do I deserve happiness when it would come at the cost of extreme sadness for her? I know that the answer that is yes, but I just don't know how I can do that to her. She has been with me through everything that I have went through, and made huge sacrifices to make it work between us... We have a real connection and even though it is strained sometimes, there are still some real feelings there,,, aren't there? Fuck I don't even know. I feel like my head is jumbled up and nothing I can do can clear my mind.\n\nI feel like I am at a crossroads and my next decision will impact who I am as a person and what I end up like.

{"prompt":"So I have liked this girl for the past year or so. We've been nothing but friends so far & only talk online (we met once in passing but at the start of the friendship). She currently is in a long distance relationship of 6 months with a guy a few years older than me. I completely respect that fact & I would not want her (or anyone) to break up their relationship for me. \n\nHowever, she opened up to me the other day about how she's having problems & they argue a lot. I gave her some friendly advice about what to do. She then started to sort things out with the issues they are having. \n\nThis was fine with me, I'm glad she's sorted it out but I get very mixed signals from her. We have pretty deep conversations. The other day we were talking about how well we get along and our preferences in the opposite and we both sorta match each others' criteria.

{"prompt":"I work a pretty great job that has a very flexible set up. While I'm assigned to work on various projects by my manager, part of my time is allowed for the development of my own self-initiated projects so long as they can be used to help the company in the future.

This is great, and I'm happy for him except I've noticed a slow creep in my workload increasing as a result. It's nothing drastic so far, but I'm slowly becoming the person others default to in terms of making requests, asking me to attending meetings, etc. because the my co-worker is now not available part of the week and protects his time off by not answering email, etc. on days when he's out. As a result, my time spent on self-initiated projects is starting to decrease. \n\nHow do I talk to my manager about my concerns over the slow creep of my co-worker's former work into my workload? Even though my co-worker informed me he was switching to part-time, our manager never discussed this fact with me at all or what it means for me. I'm also not really sure what he can say given that there is no one else with similar expertise that can take the burden and our company only hires in April. We work in high enough demand positions where I can easily leave and get a new job if someone were to tell me to just suck it up and take it, but I'd really not resort to that.

{"prompt":"This wasn't today, this was in the summer of '95.\n\nI was making decent money living at home and lifeguarding during the summer.  Had a car that I had saved up to install a sound system.  I got Infinity speakers, Alpine V12 amp, and a [Sony CDX-C910] head unit.  This head unit was the most expensive, therefore best (teenager, remember) thing I could buy.

{"prompt":"Hey everyone. My roommate and I are coming to the end of 2 years of living together. Long story short, I will not continue to live with him beyond 2 years.\n\nWe used to work together and I thought he had his act together. Little did I know it was all a front. He hardly leaves the apartment besides to go to work, never buys household goods, barely cleans up after himself, and definitely doesn't do his fair share of things around the apt.\n\nHe's generally a nice guy but he's completely oblivious and can be really inconsiderate. For example we used to smoke (weed) together from time to time. I am for the most part cool with it. Then it started turning into 12 hour smoke sessions where he would sit in his room all day smoking. I eventually asked him to stop smoking inside, but slowly he started to again. Finally one night, I had had enough and I called him out and he's taken to smoking outside.\n\nSo here's what happened. At the beginning of the month he told me a friend of his needed a place to stay for a few days. I obliged under the agreement that she wouldn't be in the apt all day (I'm working from home and interviewing, speaking on the phone with privileged information, financials, etc.)\n\nHere we are almost two weeks later. She's been here almost every day. The one day she wasn't here, he had his FWB staying the night.\n\nI'm incredibly annoyed at this point. I texted him yesterday (as I knew I wouldn't be home when he was.) Yet he never replied.

I don't know how to tell him I only said it cause I was drunk, so I run with it. He leaves me in bed and goes downstairs, I go back to sleep. I wake up several hours later still alone. This rest of the day is slightly awkward, I try cuddling up to him on the sofa and he shrugs me off. We go out that night and he invites a friend of his along. (I was only over for 2 nights.)

As a kid I was a natural born extrovert, the rare class clown who also got straight A's. I was born with that kind of lion-esque confidence that some people have.\n\nIn middle school I had that confidence beaten out of me, either with fists or with words. By high school I trusted no one and assumed that everyone was out to get me. While I can now see how stupid that was, I couldn't then. Hating everyone didn't get me many friends, or girlfriends. After I lost my virginity I got a little of that confidence back and started getting with girls pretty regularly, but that didn't last long. After the first ugly breakup with a girl I went right back into a shell.\n\nSo now I'm a freshman at a small community college and it's very hard to meet people.

{"prompt":"My mother owns a small apparel boutique and I work there as manager. We also employ four shop girls. Recently one of the women who works for us asked for two weeks off because her daughter was having a baby and she wanted to be there to support her. Unfortunately, this time coincided with my mother being out of town for a week. I expected to pick up the extra hours myself.\n\nWithout consulting me AT ALL (which I think is out of line because I'm the manager), my mother hires New Girl as a temp employee. By all accounts, New Girl is a great employee. She had no previous experience in retail, but she learned quickly and her first week I had a handful of customers seek me out specifically to compliment her. That's great, we love to hear that sort of thing.\n\nThe end of her temp employment is coming up, when my mother mentions she wants to bring New Girl on permanently. I tell her we don't have room in the schedule (because we don't, we'd have to cut everyone's hours severely to accommodate her). My mother says we can fire another shop girl, a high schooler who has been with us about six months. She says that from purely a numbers standpoint, New Girl makes more sales.\n\nI am against this. I can't believe she's being this disloyal to her own staff. I also take issue with New Girl's appearance. She simply does not look the level of polished as the other women we employ. I asked her once if she wore make up and she told me she was wearing make up then, but in my opinion it is not enough. I also learned that she does not use heat products in her hair. This has never been a problem with our other employees, and I have no idea how to address this, because how do you tell a woman she needs to wear more make up? My mother doesn't mind, but she's always been more bohemian, which is fine but not the look I care to have represented at our boutique.\n\nFrankly, I think my mother is allowing personal feelings to get in the way of professionalism. She seems dead set on this, though.

He would text me almost every weekend asking to hang out, but I was always busy.\n\nFinally I agree, and we go to a movie, but I'm 99% sure that was just as friends. We bought our tickets separately and met inside the theater. Nothing happened there.\n\nWell, after that, we started texting\/chatting online a lot. We had a lot of interesting conversations and he kept mentioning that I was really nice and that I gave good advice. Somehow we got on the topic of sex one day and since then, things kind of got stuck there? We ended up sexting a few times.\n\nHe tends to flirt with anything with breasts, so I was weary of his flirting. But at one point i asked him why he had to go after so many women. That one is enough. He responded saying if one were to take him, that would be enough. I told him that shouldn't be hard to find, and he simply replied with \"Who? You?\". I said I couldn't answer that, and he didn't pursue much further. Then we just ended up sexting..\n\nI don't know if I'm assuming things because of the sexting or if it's valid to think he might be interested in more than just \"sexting buddies\" (if that's a thing.. I don't know). I've never done that before so I don't know the procedure.\n\nLike I said, he is the kind of guy that flirts with anything with breasts, but when talking to him privately, I've kind of figured that it's all kind of a muse to hide insecurities. I just don't know if he's doing this with me because I'm a female and willing, or if he actually likes me and wants more than that.. I'm not the most attractive person, so I can only assume he's actually genuine and not in it just to get in my pants, because no one wants that.. not in 3 years.","chosen":"I'm not sure if he's flirting\/sexting me for reasons of insecurity\/a desire for attention or if he actually likes me.","rejected":"Met a guy, we've been sexting.

Since I already told my friends I would see them that weekend, I hatched this new plan of going to see my friends on Friday and then hopping a bus to the city where the party is on Saturday, since my girlfriend won't be there until then anyway. I thought this was a no-brainer great solution, when I told her she seemed mad. She said \"I'm just confused, it seemed like you originally didn't even want to go.

As we were figuring out expenses, my dad told me I'd be paying $200 a month on the paid off car I've been driving since I was 16. Before I go any further, let me make it clear that I did not expect this car for free. My mom actually intended to give it to me as a sort of \"gift\" when I leave because it used to be her car, but then my dad got involved. And he is absolutely pissed that I'm leaving. I think $200 is way too steep for the car. I asked him if he'd be willing to do $150, but nope. \n\nHe said he could provide everything in full if he *wanted* to, but he does not want to help a single thing because he is so upset. I did not expect or even ask to provide for anything, but I still think that he was trying to prove a point by saying that. Among the car there are other things he's unwilling to do like co-sign my student loan, etc. All of these things to prove the point that he's mad. All of these things he also supported my other siblings with when they moved out. \n\nI asked him what the $200 would go towards since the car is paid off and he said that isn't my business. I told him again I would really appreciate it if he would do $150, that is a difference between having a day off for school and whatnot, but nope. \n\nMy question for you, \/r\/relationships, do you think my dad is being spiteful with this?

Whenever we're really busy, I'll grab his ipod and change it from \"Repeat All\" to \"Repeat Song\". So instead of just looping his playlist, it just starts looping the same song indefinitely.\n\nSince I do this when we're busy, he usually doesn't notice for a good 20 minutes, and when he finally does, he grabs his ipod and goes \"WHAT THE FUCK, STOP\" -- I'm pretty sure he thinks his iPod's malfunctioning.\n\nHowever long it takes, I plan on making him so sick of that playlist he never wants to hear it again.","chosen":"Coworker plays the same 20ish song playlist every day.

Yesterday during marching drill before actual practice began, me and some friends were all sitting outside in the small parking lot we have for band and sports personnel. The lot had been empty up until a few minutes before \"the event\" happened. I never noticed a car had come in, and was talking with a friend. Keeping eye contact and walking backwards at a moderate pace as she followed. Last second she yells \"PintoBean, STOP!\" and I quickly stop, stumble over my foot and fall straight back... into a car.

{"prompt":"So, I've been seeing this guy for 3 years and we've had our fair share of issues with adultery\/cheating, which I thought we had solved.\n\nRewind to few months ago, I randomly saw his phone go off and saw a name pop up with a text. We'll call her Quinn. I'm just kind of curious so I ask him about it and he doesn't say anything. For days and days, I try to get an answer out of him and finally he tells me he's known her for years and plans to have a relationship with her but she has a husband and baby. He explains that she's \"unhappy\" and \"stuck\" in a relationship she doesn't want to be in because they live with the husbands parents.\n\nI really honestly don't believe it, for one, if you're unhappy in a relationship, just bring that Shit up.

Until he leaves his phone unlocked one day, and seeing as we've had problems before and he grabs his phone away from me any time he sees I have it, I look at the conversation going on. He's telling her that he's unhappy with me and that he wants to actually be \"happy\" and actually love someone... I broke down. \n\nI brought it up as calmly as I could and instead of explaining he went off on me for \"invading his privacy\" and left like he always does when he's losing\/has no way to defend himself.\n\nMy question is, what should I do about it since he won't listen to me and it hasn't stopped?

A few of our mutual friends think it is abusive.\n\nI was really happy to be friends with her, until her drunken boyfriend lashed out at me for no reason.

So we did that \"job\" and fro  that point on my life changed completely, I started helping as many friends as I could with the fights and they were asking for help because I can hold my own in a fight (trained mma for 5 years). Just a little clarification, when I said beating peopme up for money I don't mean robbing them. Whenever someone that we knew wanted to beat a guy or more up he called us and after it was done he would give us money.\n\nNowadays I'm completely different, at 16 I moved to another country and I realized how bad I was falling and how lucky I was with the moving.

Throughout our friendship there are a few things I have noticed about her. \n\n1.\tShe is extremely insecure, recently she lost a lot of weight and I tried to tell her she looked great, however she couldn't accept the compliment and be proud of what she has accomplished so far. That is just an example but it runs a lot deeper than that.\n\n2.\t I'm not sure if her and her boyfriend want to be together anymore or if they are staying together because they have been together for so long\/ fear of being alone (been together since grade nine)\nIn regards to the boyfriend, he has broken up with her 3 or 4 times and she always begs for him to take her back and he always does.\n\nHe just recently purchased a house with his father without consulting her on location or her desires for their home. The house is outside of the city and away from all of the things she values and she has told me that she is very upset about the purchase. (I just found out this information last night)\n\n3.\tI found she has become stagnant in her growth, she never steps outside her comfort zone and doesn't believe in herself.\n\nI haven't talked to her in almost 8 months because she was becoming very frustrating with all of these factors. Always complaining and never feeling good about herself. Well last night she called me to see if I wanted to get some coffee with her. I agreed but I'm not sure If it's my place to bring up that I think she needs professional help, or if recommending it would be a good idea.","chosen":"My friend has become very insecure, stagnant in her growth and is very insecure with her relationship.

Everything has been fine, but lately I've been in a bad depression. I have lost interest in everything and I really have no desire to be intimate which  is really getting to her.  Also, im irritable on top of the depression so im constantly lashing out verbally. Im trying to see a psychologist but my insurance doesnt cover it so I have to pay a huge chunk of money every visit. I cant afford it right now. \n\nThroughout this depression Ive had moments of semi-happiness. So when I have those moments and im still not interested in anything or intimate, she takes it as im losing interest in her, Which I AM NOT.

{"prompt":"So I've been friends with a girl for several months now. At the time we met, she was dating and living with a guy I considered a friend for a while. She told me they were having issues and could end up stuck here (she's from out of the state). I told her that if that ever happened she could stay with me until she figured out what to do. Fast forward a few months and she finds out he was cheating on her, so she packed up and has been staying with me for a few weeks now. Her original intention was to go home but she decided to keep working at her job and live with me a while longer.\n\nWe grew close and developed a physical and somewhat of an emotional relationship. Things were fine, and she's been sleeping next to me every night. So the other day, things were fine, but her ex wanted her to come over and talk, so she did. When she got home, she came home late, and was very distant. She promised they didn't have sex or anything. She started to apologize saying she's a burden to everyone and she's tired of ruining everyone's life. She wouldn't tell me what she talked to him about, just that he seemed like a different person and she feels he is up to something. Since then she won't lay next to me, or hold my hand or anything. She said it's just a \"mood\" and she has them quite often. \n\nI know most people would say, \"Get out now, don't be a rebound\". But I still feel like there's the potential for more. I'm not sure if I should back off some and let her heal, or back off because she's trying to work things out with him. I want to avoid being a rebound, but I also feel like if I distance myself, she'll get lonely and start to see him more. I'm sure he's going to ask to see her again, and I don't know if I should try and stop her or tell her to go. Any advice is appreciated.","chosen":"Girl I like is living with me.

I was never close to this girl or the guy, but definitely knew who they were, greeted them in passing, etc.\n\nThis weekend 26F and I were at the same bar, people all night had been saying she dumped her guy, and then she told me the same. Moved to an after party that she invited me to and there she was openly hitting on me. I let her initiate everything. I assumed we'd make out and then she'd bail, but she invited my back to her place, initiated taking off my clothes, her clothes, and getting the condom. Sex was great. \n\nI assumed it was a one time thing given the circumstances but she's been texting me so that led me to look her up. Found that Facebook and Instagram still have all their \"in a relationship\" status and couples pictures up so now I'm feeling a little guilty and worried about the whole thing. \n\nShe outright stated to me and everyone at the party that they were broken up. I did ask her if it was a temporary or permanent break and she said never say never but it's over indefinitely. It's a hippie\/yoga\/weed crew so I took that as they have no plans to get back together but there's no way of predicting the universe... that kind of philosophy.

Our previous dates were always a bit awkward because we were both nervous and I've always found it hard to talk to the opposite sex (so lots of silence).\n\nSo I began talking to her again last week and I decided not to beat around the bush and asked if she wanted to catch up for coffee to which she agreed. So the beginning of the date kind of started awkward i found her eyes kept moving around the room and wouldn't keep eye contact for long, there were moments of short awkward pauses like before, she asked me questions about my family and about other things but I felt I was asking her more questions. The second half i felt we became more comfortable she kept moving her hair behind her ear, would smile more and kept eye contact more and we ended up talking straight for just over an hour.

Had to wait 1 month just to be told they had no job for me. 2 weeks later, I go to mcdonalds interview and didn't get it because it was an on-call job. Next up is kmart interview. I'm  guessing I didn't get it becuase I was quiet durimg the interview. Then I said fuck it, going to apply to pizza hut again. I get the call, go to the interview, and they tell me to go today at 11 a.m. I thought \"fuck yes, finally a job!.\" But that's not the case. My parents are telling me not to take it because it's a \"dangerous\" job. My dad and I basically got into an argument for the first time today becuase they didn't want me to get that job. He said if I don't take it, he'll give me $100 a month (yeah cause that's a lot for a 19 year old..) He says to not take get the job for my mom.

{"prompt":"I'm bisexual but not out to many and I have never been with a girl, although I have wanted to for a long time. At a festival I volunteered at 3 months ago I was put on shift with a girl I'll call Hannah. Me and Hannah spent a lot of time together on shift and using her sharp gaydar I'm pretty sure she began to suspect I liked girls, so she dropped a few hints that she was gay and then made a few passes at me. I was too shy to reciprocate, especially because at that point I wasn't out to the people I attended the festival with, who me and Hannah were also working with. I stupidly left my last shift without her number and never saw her again. So today while scrolling through the volunteer group Facebook page I found a post by someone that looked a lot like her had made about a week ago, and it did turn out to be Hannah.

{"prompt":"The following takes place in the state of Ohio, I'll try to keep it brief but it's a little complicated, thanks in advance for any advice:\n\nMy wife and I found a rental house that was perfect for us to move into in mid September. Our apartment's lease does not end until Nov. 30, however. It was mid-August at the time, we let our landlord at large apartment complex know we planned to move out in roughly a month, and they told us, to my surprise, that our only options were to pay a \"lease abandonment fee\" of 2 months rent from the end of a 30 days notice OR find a replacement tenant to take over our lease, for who they would refuse to do the usual cleaning\/maintenance done during typical turnover.\n\nThe first option is virtually no different than paying the remainder of our rent, however, and does not seem to be a good faith attempt at mitigating damages, namely because our apartment could easily be re-rented in a far shorter time. In fact, after I told the landlord's office I would attempt to find a replacement tenant, they contacted me to tell me someone was interested in my apartment since it is the only one of our model that will be available in the near future. The leasing agent said she would try to get approval from her manager to have the new tenant start a new 12 month lease with the apartment cleaned. However, she was shot down and told he could only \"take over\" my current lease, then renew if he wanted. \n\nWell, since we have a cat (he is allergic) he did not want to move into an apartment that was possibly uncleaned (I offered to pay for cleaning - the landlord ignored this and the new guy obviously wouldn't want to depend on a former tenant's word that has no longer any stake). I don't see how this sabotage of a potential new tenant is any different than refusing to re-rent and mitigate damages.

{"prompt":"Dated my ex for about a year, we went on a few trips together, met each other's family and friends, and essentially lived together for a short period. I was going through some big changes with graduating college and finding a job that was fulfilling for me- my hopes and dreams were a bit unrealistic, and I only worked on and off during college so it was a stressful transition. Anyway, I leaned too much on him for emotional support because we were always around one another and I didn't consider the amount of strain it would put on the relationship. We had other problems, namely expectations of his friends and family. I'm kind of a proponent of the idea that expectations skew reality, but whatever, people still see what they're primed to see.\n\nI think we both wanted to take the relationship to the next level but the reality is that we're not logistically at the same point in life and we might never be.

So I woke up at 3:30 am with an officer shinning a light in my face and asking who I was and if I had been drinking, then two more officers came in my room and started looking in the closet, under the bed, etc. In my sleepy state I somehow put together that it was April 1st and that this must be a prank (Totally within the realm of possibility with my friends) so I started to chuckle and said \"Bullshit!\" and pointed at the cop asking me things.

Couldn't sleep the rest of the night and then had an early class and a fun story.","chosen":"might've been pranked by a cop and thought I was being pranked by my roommate, ended up not being pranked.","rejected":"Dont fucking play pranks on your friends, or cops, they'll think you're a child and you're probably going to get arrested."}
{"prompt":"So there's this girl I've been into for a while and I've been suspecting she feels the same. We've done light stuff like making out, ect. in the past, but she's had this on and off boyfriend for the last 2 years and she's known him for way longer than she's known me.\n\nRecently, we were drinking together and one thing led to another. We ended up on her porch making out and I told her how I felt. She told me she had feelings for me also and that she liked the thought of being with me more than her current bf.\n\nProblem is, she's leaving in four months to grad school and won't be anywhere near where we both are now. She's not sure what to do with the whole situation, neither am I. What do I do?","chosen":"Been into this girl for a while, recently told her I liked her, she said she had feelings for me and more, she's leaving to grad school.

{"prompt":"Hey everyone,\n\nI know these questions are asked often, but like everyone else it seems I am unable to decipher this for myself.\n\nTo add a background: I have known this girl for 4\/5 years (family friends) and we always got along. \n\nShe got out of a 2 year relationship about 4~months ago, she was broken up with, and I think isnt quite over it yet. Still not too sure about that.\n\nAnyways, we recently have hung about a fair amount and alot of people we know are pairing us up together in their minds and letting us know individually, never when we are together, and we have mentioned it briefly to each other.\n\nGenerally I feel like she is acting flirty, although I could be misinterpreting it. However, the thing I have an issue with is that occasionally she still mentions that she loves her ex, this could be her overselling\/wanting some level of attention or deflecting from 'us', or she may still be getting over her ex. Additionally she mentions that she doesn't think she will date for a while.\n\nKnow, I know this seems like I'm reading too much into her 'flirtatious' actions and she may in fact just be acting friendly. But I wouldn't ask this if I thought that was all there was to it.\n\nSo my question is, am I completely off the track? Should I just leave her be? Or should I pay closer attention to the situation?\n\nGenerally cliche I know, but any help would be appreciated.","chosen":"Known girl for years, hung about a fair bit, acts flirty sometimes but could just be friendly. Is it\/was it justified? Should I pay closer attention or leave her be?","rejected":"Girl acts flirty but may be deflecting\/overselling herself in relation to her ex, not sure if I should move on or pay closer attention to the situation."}
{"prompt":"I knew this person in high school and we were both interested in each other. It never worked out although I have had dreams about this person ever since (8 years of dreams). They aren't sexual dreams, but this is really, really wearing on me. In the dreams I am very happy to be with her and when I wake up I am devastated. The worst part is that I am currently in a relationship and know that this other girl is single. I went for lunch with her a little over a year ago to see how she was doing and we seemed to both enjoy ourselves. I have not pursued this relationship because I am in a fairly good relationship and feel delusional thinking this \"dream\" relationship could work out.","chosen":"I am in love with a person who I have had dreams about for years and have not been able to pursue it.","rejected":"I am in love with someone I barely know and can't possibly be with her.

{"prompt":"Four weeks ago, a mouse I adopted had six babies.  All the babies looked like [wrinkly pink jelly beans]  Nothing was amiss.  \n\nDay 6 or so, we thought it was safe to [begin handling the babies]  All babies looked fit and healthy and [were all the same size]  It appeared as though they were having trouble moving their hind legs, but I chocked that up to them just learning to walk.  I noticed it especially in the dark grey-brown ones, but in hindsight, maybe I had been handling the same mouse every time thinking that they were different.  The only female was the white one, the rest were males, which made it even harder to differentiate between the three ones of the same color.\n\nOnce they really started growing hair and we handled them for hours at a time, we noticed [this guy]  Do you see anything odd about him?  How about if we [compare him to his brother]  At first we thought he was paralyzed, but it soon became clear that was not the case.  He could move his tail and his hind legs freely, but he didn't do it often.  When he did decide to move his legs, the movements were stiff.  He could curl his toes.  He used his whole leg like a flipper to push himself along the table.  We named him Forrest, after Forrest Gump, because he is a determined bugger who can't walk or do any mouse things as well as his brothers.  \n\nNow, he is one third the size of his family.  He developed slower than the others after day 12; his eyes opened about 4 days later, he took the longest to wean, and he is the least adventurous (understandably). \n\nAs with most random mouse pregnancies, there is a chance of the litter being a result of inbreeding.  His body size makes me think it's not an environmental or physical cause, which leads me to genetic disease.  Do his symptoms sound like anything you know about?  My google-fu has failed me, but I am only a trainee.  Thus, Forrest and I turn to you for help.","chosen":"Baby mouse is crippled with an atrophied hind end, is 1\/3rd the size of his brothers, developed slowly.  What disease could this be?","rejected":"A mouse has a genetic disease that makes it difficult for him to move his hind legs.  He is the smallest of his litter.  He is also the most determined.  What does he look like?"}
{"prompt":"I'm gonna drop the pretentious stuff and just get to the point.\n\nI realize that it is incredibly important to finish college. Here's the problem. I'm one of those guys who since he was young people have fawned over me being so smart. I never studied in school. I was lazy. I've had a lot of crappy stuff happen growing up too. My dad died when I was 9, I've moved across the country, my mother is completely insane (serious) so I've always kinda raised myself.\n\nI suck as a parent (at least to myself.)\n\nI don't know why I am the way I am. But I want to fucking change.\nI've been in community college since '07 I took a year off, and have been doing a few classes at a time. At this rate, I'll get out of college by the time I'm 35. I want to be able to just bow up and become this homework\/school master and freaking be able to study and all that crap everyone else does.\n\nMy apologies, but I'm fairly emotionally right now. Many of the \"stupid jocks\" I graduated with are about to graduate college. Some of these guys did things like.. Oh yeah, let's see who can stay drunk the longest! 1 month in one guy's kidney's and liver started acting up so they stopped.. BUT MOTHER FUCKER HOW THE HELL ARE THEY ABOUT TO GRADUATE IN A FEW MONTHS?","chosen":"I've had a hard time growing up, was lavished as being smart and great for taking care of myself...

I asked her friends for her address so I could send it to her but they think it's best for her not to hear from me as I bring up bad memories. I cannot message her myself as she has blocked me on all social media. \n\nI really still love her and I think there could be a slim chance that we could get back together, we've been apart for about 2 months now.

{"prompt":"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 2 months now since the 4th, and the relationship between her and I is wonderful. We get along extremely well, and love each other very much. \n\n-\n\nShe has had a hard past, and even present. Her father left the family when she was young, and she hates every thought of him. Her mother had to support her two daughters for many years working many jobs, which led to not much one-on-one with her loved ones. All of my girlfriends life she has been scarred by past events and it has left her a very sensitive person which I completely respect.\n\n-\n\nHer mom remarried to a different man and they had 3 more children, so the total is 5 living in one household. Financially they are stable, but sometimes not everyone gets along and the love often feels distant for her (my girlfriend). \n\n-\n\nHer moms attitude towards her is usually very negative, and they even physically take it out on each other - her mother starting most of the trouble. She takes most of her anger out on my girlfriend which I am less than okay with. She shames her, hits her, and is the main cause of her mild depression. \n\n-\n\nOverall, the relationship between my girlfriend and her mother is growing distant and she is actually scared of her. Her mom puts her down on almost every occasion, and makes her feel like everything bad and terrible that has happened to her is her fault. I love my girlfriend to death and only want to see things get better for her.","chosen":"Girlfriends mom is extremely negative and harsh towards her, causing extreme stress in our otherwise happy relationship.

{"prompt":"[This is a video of what we're trying to achieve.](\n\nMy school currently has a Sony HVR-HD1000u, and compared to that, our videos are nowhere near as good. I understand that things like lighting and color correction play a pretty big role, but even then I feel like our videos are never that clean. I usually can't get 720p clips out of our camera and the slow motion that they have is something we can't even come close to.\n\nOne possible *problem* is that for some reason we can't use firewire to connect the camera to the computer so we have to play the tape on this thing that basically plays it and then we capture the tape playing. I feel like this is probably a huge problem because it's like trying to show a friend a movie by screen-capping from Skype.\n\nSO, should we scrap the HVR-HD1000u and get a Canon T2i (a cheaper DSLR which from the samples I've seen on YouTube and clips from that video, seems pretty high quality), or continue trying to use the Sony?","chosen":"We have a Sony HVR-HD1000u camera and we want to upgrade to a Canon T2i.","rejected":"What is a camera that can shoot high quality video that is cheap enough to be used for music videos that can be used with a firewire connection to a computer?"}
{"prompt":"Honey, I love it when you hold me close to you and reassure me that you would never cheat on me...again. You did in that first year we were dating, and we took two months to cool things off and try to regain trust. I gave you a second chance. But now, I can't even think about you even talking to another girl. Because I was so unaware of what plans you had in store the first time. Even typing this, I feel like I want to scream and throw things around. \n\nI get sick in my stomach and I don't have female friends...all because I'm afraid of competition. I'll admit it: I'm really insecure. I need male attention to feel good. But feeling like any girl you befriend is going to stab me in the back and take your heart away from me...it's eating me alive. \n\nI can't tell you how many hours I've spent aware planning our next fight. But things don't get better, because you say it's all in my head, that I'm making things up, and seeing them as worse than they are. And way deep down, I know that you love me more than anything. These last three years have been the best of my life - but also very stressful. \n\nBut I want you all to myself. And if my \"crazy\" behavior (isn't that how your best friend put it?) is what it takes to keep you, then damnit - I'll keep it up. \n\nI need you. You're what's left of my family, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.","chosen":"After you cheated on me, I can't take you even talking to other girls.

{"prompt":"Let's limit my question to parties where there are a bunch of folks who at least all share the host(ess) in common (as opposed to bars). I have no problem connecting with strangers in this type of situation and love to engage people and talk.\n\nOccasionally, I'll click really well with someone. We'll have had a great conversation, a lot of flirting, and there's clearly some interest. But when it comes time to actually ask the person out\/suggest they come home with me, I freeze up and end in a, \"Welp! Great talking to you!\"\n\nI find this applies both to potential casual hookups and potential dates. Though there is more pressure if it's a potential hookup.\n\nI feel like there is never a good time to ask either question. I feel like everyone around us is watching me and listening in, waiting to hear me ask this person this question and either ready to laugh or shake their heads in solemn shame.\n\nThis happened twice this weekend. Saturday party, met a fantastic woman, but could not bring myself to ask her out (though, she is the sister of a friend, so that added a bit of pressure to it). Then, Sunday BBQ at my own apartment, cute girl shows up, is clearly into the idea of maybe sticking around until morning (the hints were not very subtle, and I was totally into the idea), but I just can't make it happen because she's my roommate's girlfriend's friend, and I feel like they'll get all judgy. Even though they'd probably encourage it in the end.\n\nI met my last girlfriend at a party in this sort of situation, but could not bring myself to ask her out in front of people, and instead found her and messaged her on Facebook (which she was surprisingly ok with). I'd like to not have to do that again and just ask someone out like a normal person.\n\nAgain, I generally have no social anxieties and can hold myself in a crowd of strangers. But this triggers some sort of fear in me.","chosen":"I [30\/M] always have a bit of trouble sealing the deal: transitioning from flirty talk and clear signals of interest to actually doing something about it","rejected":"Sometimes flirty talk and clear signals of interest doesn't translate into anything concrete or deep enough to actually ask someone out.

{"prompt":"Driving back from a breakfast outing I saw an unmarked cop car sitting adjacent to us at the intersection as i prepared to turn left, i pointed to the unmarked car and looked to my girlfriend and said \"thats a subtle one but thats a cop\" My arrow went green and i took the left turn and shortly after i saw the aforementioned unmarked cop make a u-turn into our direction only to see his lights turn on shortly after and get pulled over. The offices, seemingly in plain clothes approached my car and without hesitation shouted at me asking why i was going so fast. I replied saying my car was in neutral and i was gling downhill but i surely wasnt going more that maybe 5 over if anything at all. He replied to me \"No not here back there at the light where you turned left!\" I was confused to say the least and he ripped the license and registration from my hand and went back to his car only to return with a ~$250 ticket for speeding which he basically threw at me before storming off. The ticket stated that i was \"Clocked\" and \"Estimated\" going 57 in a 40 which i definitley was not. I could not have come from 0 mph to 57 mph before taking that left turn in the 1999 car that i drive, not even on a good day could most standard cars do that nor would I do that with a passenger in my car on a major road.","chosen":"Pulled over for speeding by an apparently angry police officer in Massachusetts.","rejected":"Pulled over for speeding by seemingly escalated cop in MA, ticket stated \"clocked\" speed of 57 and \"estimated\" speed of 40, i could not have been in 0 mph to 57 mph with a passenger in my car"}
{"prompt":"Throwaway Account. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for three months and known each other for eight years. \n\nHe has had a job for three years and his family often deposits some extra cash for him in his bank account. He has close to 15k saved up so far. \n\nI have never had a job up until this summer. I live with a single dad and three other siblings so money is very tight. I am the eldest out of my siblings so it's only my dad and I who work. \n\nOn the very first date I went with my boyfriend, I had offered to pay for my movie ticket. He insisted that I don't have to. He said the same thing for the next couple of movie dates. He even said \"dinner is on me\" on several occasions even though I insisted I could pay for my half of the food\/ticket. \n\nMoving along, throughout the entire relationship (thus far) he has paid for me since I didn't have any source of income. We even share a Netflix account for $8.99. I have been keeping track of how much I owe him so I could pay him back as soon as I got a job. It's about $150 (including Netflix). So far I have paid him back $50 in small amounts of money. \n\nNow, the problem is that today he demanded that he needs the money and I pay him back asap. I told him that I'll give him the money back in small instalments and not all at once as I have other responsibilities. He then went on and said he wants all the money from the start (including all the tickets\/foods that he insisted I don't pay for...lol wtf. Why would you tell me in the first place to not pay at all if you wanted the money back). He then went on and started questioning me if I will ever pay him back...
