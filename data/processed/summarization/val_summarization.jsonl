They came back after renting a movie and put it in. Now as a kid I was a huge pussy, like scared of his own shadow kind of thing. Now if you had read the Goosbump stories as a little kid you will know they are actually fucked.. well my sister had gotten the movie \"The Werewolf of Fever Swamp\" and after about 25 minutes of watching the movie I was fucking terrified. My sister got to scared and went upstairs and it was only me sitting on the couch in a dark room shitting my pants. Now I would of gone upstairs but I was to scared to turn my head (yes I was a pussy) fearing that their was a Werewolf sitting right behind me getting ready to eat me as soon as I looked backwards. Now if you have seen the movie then you would know that their is a scene when the character is running from the Werewolf and the Werewolf falls into a pit of quicksand or something. Well I had recurring nightmares until I was 14 from that scene. I would wake up in a swamp and see a Werewolf running at me and I would start to run away, the Werewolf would easily catch me and then try to eat my face and as it went in for the bite I would wake up sweating and terrified.

{"prompt":"My girlfriend and I broke up about a month ago. Since then, I've come to see the things that were my fault. She did some shit too, but most of the things she did were based on the fact that I was being a shitty boyfriend in some way or another. I don't think that absolves her of her responsibility for her actions, but it does make it a hell of a lot easier for me to forgive her for them. The trouble is, I love her, very much. And I do want to give it another shot. The things that I did wrong were mostly just taking her for granted. She's dating someone else right now, but I think that will end at some point. So I told her all of this, that I love her, want to spend the rest of my life with her, and I see the areas that I fucked up and really do think that I can change them (even saying that as a guy makes me feel like I'm conforming to some cliche, but I do actually mean it). When I told her this, she said that she really liked what I was saying, but our relationship deteriorated so much toward the end that she thinks it would take some time for her to not feel like we were just jumping back into it at the shitty point. I think I agree with her. If we got back into it right now, she would be standoffish and I would be paranoid and suspicious.

{"prompt":"So I have been dating my girlfriend for about 2 years now.  Seems to be going good most of the time but we have one main issue that keeps coming up.  She hates one of my friends who is a girl.  This girl has been my friend for 6-7 years all through college and the years after.  Me and this friend have never had sex or kissed or dated or anything, it has always been strictly friendship.  After a while my girlfriend told me she is uncomfortable with my and her close friendship and thinks that I am closer to my friend than her.  So I pretty much stop hanging out with this friend and only talk very occasionally.  However it is difficult since this friend is part of my circle of friends and is a good friend of my roommates and also a roommate of one of my very good friends.\n\nTo me this is an issue with her trusting me.  I have never cheated, nor came close to cheating on her with anyone.  I am a trustworthy person, I dont go out late partying or anything like that anymore.  And I know sometimes her ex's text her and she gives them quick blow-off replies and such but I never worry about it because I trust her.  I also don't like the idea of being told whom I can and cant be friends with if the relationship with this person is only based in friendship.\n\nAm I in the wrong here?

The training mode bill is then filed away somewhere, and as far as I can ascertain it's written off as theft\/shrink through the store. The only reason I can gather that they do this is so they are actually paying a lower amount for their groceries, maybe it works out so they are just paying for groceries at what they cost the store vs. what a customer would pay, that's my guess anyway.\n\nI don't really know how the ordering\/costs work for grocery stores and if they are even getting the groceries cheaper but I assume so because why else would they do that?

However, I'm just getting around to paying my bills for that period and I realized that my utilities bill is MUCH higher than usual. I've never seen my bill this high before and fall usually has the cheapest months because the climate is so neutral. Unlike most apartment buildings that I know of, each unit is responsible for it's own utilities, meaning that every bill I receive is for my own apartment's usage (instead of a total cost that is split between all of the tenants throughout the building).

I thought I was doing the right thing by letting her use my place for free, but now I'm wondering if I should bring this up. \n\nIf I'm ever in a position again where I let someone use my apartment, should I make some sort of stipulation about energy usage?

He had also made it clear to me that I was the one he wanted to end up with, and the idea of likely getting back together with him was something I was working towards.\n\nSince I found out about this new girl I can barely breathe.

Girls night out, game nights, to watch shows or sports, to movies and also parties. \n\nI have no reason to think she is cheating. She has admirers but they haven't changed her habits any and haven't gotten any closer to her. I checked the obvious things like fb and text (I have permission) and saw nothing.

Her wardrobe has expanded but it was always good and she has always been known for her style. Maybe one style related thing is that she has gotten into a kick of dressing like she did in college again since the 90s stuff has come back in.

I have no idea what this all entails, but I assume(d) that the general rules of relationships would apply. My Roommate is a friend(yes, I know...\"she won't be your friend after living together\") However, her anxiety and personal issues have resulted in some issues....\n\n    Having my boyfriend over, for example. We are private people and generally stay in my room reading books together. However, my roommate screamed that he is not allowed over at all, because it would make her uncomfortable. Now, I am paying my fair share of rent, we've split it evenly, even though she gets the bigger room. I feel that I should be allowed to have him sleep over on occasion so long as he isn't disruptive, noisy, peeing on the toilet seat, or putting the TP under instead of over. We have currently negotiated 4 days a month. She also does not want my friends over, ever.\n\n    I originally had plans to move in on Thursday\/Friday, however due to last minute plans, I had to switch to Friday\/Sunday. This resulted in us being there together Sunday. I was met with stomping everywhere she went and silence to any questions I asked....She is now saying that there will never, ever, be plan changes ever again. The first plan is the only plan. I have tried reasoning with her, telling her that she could have told me no to moving in Sunday, instead of throwing a temper tantrum, but she is set. When I tried reasoning with her, she told me that clearly I cannot think like an adult, therefore she is taking away my privileges to change plans. Lunch plans, dinner plans, general hanging out plans....etc. Meanwhile, she has bailed on me nearly every single time we make plans together, often only an hour or two before.\n\n    What have I gotten myself in to???

{"prompt":"My closest friend has been married for a year and a half now to a woman who completely walks all over him and doesn't bring a single good thing to the table.  She has gotten worse and worse over the last year, and currently makes him do all the household work (cleaning, cooking, fixing things, snow removal, dishes, laundry, etc).  I just found out last night that she is now quitting her job with no prospects for a new one.  He works full time, somewhat manual labor, in a high stress position.  The job she left was at a bookstore, and she quit because it was too hard and she \"didn't like it\".  She also has a new (gas guzzling) car that they make payments on, while he drives an old beater because they cannot afford anything more.  She is constantly telling him he can't buy things like a certain grocery item he wants because it's \"too expensive\", while she goes and buys designer clothing at the mall often.  The worst part is that she is a massive \"feminist\" (read: hypocrite) and feels as if she is entitled to an easy life and should be taken care of.  She also treats him like shit on a daily basis and is not afraid to order him around and berate him, even right in front of me.  The final straws for me have been his recent need to start taking anti-depression meds, and her deciding to quit her job.  He is absolutely blind to how bad the situation is (or possibly in denial), and anytime I mention something about it, he gets very defensive and sticks up for everything she does.

Now I've been into this girl since high school(huge crush) but we barely ever talked and my friend knew this so he brought me along. \n\nSo there's 5 of us just hanging out working on this video having a good time. She's so down to earth and we like a lot of the same music so it's easy to talk to her.  At one point when we were talking one on one she wouldn't stop pushing her hair back behind her ears like she was nervous talking to me. And when she showed me a graphic design video she made and I told her it was really good she got a big smile on her face,  had no idea what to say and then muttered a thank you. \n\nShe then invited me and my friend to a party that her and her friend were having this Friday. I wanna let her know I'm into her at the party but Idk what to do. I'm afraid if I'm too forward she might get so nervous she won't know what to say.

I asked her why she had a pic of her on her phone, she replied with \"it was a good picture.

{"prompt":"To put it bluntly, I'm kind of fucked up, or at least I think so. I'm a porn addict, I have anger issues, I lack healthy emotional boundaries, and am otherwise unstable much of the time. I have good streaks and bad streaks but that's not something that's healthy in a relationship.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I was in a relationship that evolved into what I can't help but call an abusive relationship (16F at the time). There were a lot of strange circumstances, a big part of which were her health issues, so I felt obligated to be there for her regardless of how much she treated me like shit. This is a very cut down version of this but she attempted suicide at one point, she was verbally abusive very often and physically abusive on occasion. I don't think all of my problems come from that situation but it's definitely a catalyst. \n\nI never hit her back whenever she was physically abusive, but I'm not sure I would react the same now. There are times I look back and wish I had retaliated (not considering that if I had, she would be in the hospital and I would be in jail). I tend to get aggressive very easily now and in my worst phases sometimes fantasize about hurting people that have angered me, particularly women. \n\nI know how much damage that can do, emotionally and physically and I don't want to do that to anyone; I would never forgive myself.  Even if I don't end up physically hurting them I feel like any relationship I ever attempt is doomed to fail just because of all my other problems (I was recently rejected by a girl that I really cared for because of all these issues). \n\nI'm not really sure what exactly I'm looking for here, maybe just some encouragement or comfort. I've been seeing a therapist for a while but may start seeing someone else as progress has been pretty slow, if not, non-existent.

I fumed for a bit but figured that was the end of it.\n\nTen minutes later I pulled into my apartment complex gate (it had one of those bars that raises and lowers after you put in a code) and there he was, idling next to it.

{"prompt":"To recap, my friend, the girl, and I hung out in the first few days of college. I've liked the girl since 7th grade, and he met her during their orientation. I met him several weeks ago when I first moved in. I panicked when my friend asked me if I was interested in her and told him no and that he should go for her. I know that I made a major mistake here. The girl and I are very good friends.\n\nI confronted my friend a few weeks later after I learned he was flirting with her. More strikes against me, I know, but he was surprisingly supportive of my situation. He offered me one chance to ask her out, and after that he would pursue her.\n\nSince the confrontation, which was very awkward but calm, I have gone with her to a rally for Herman Cain, and have hung out in her dorm. It was really unclear whether or not the Herman Cain rally was a date.

I just miss him and regret ever agreeing to our mutual breakup without ever really voicing what I wanted. \n\nI'd like to think that we will still remain close and supportive friends, and I hope we do, but being able to see his Facebook and follow his every move was just destroying me and making my depression all the more difficult to deal with. Which is why I've (finally) decided to start NC and just get on with myself. I've unfriended him and it was hard but very liberating. I know I'll certainly see him in person in the near future again due to our mutual friends and common interests, but knowing that I don't have to speak to him again unless it's on my terms is both painful and good.\n\nIt has been a horrible, painful, depressing ride but lurking around here in \/r\/Breakups and seeing that I'm not alone has helped a lot.

We get along great, we spend tons of time together, we're both pretty attractive people (i know he is, and i'd like to think i am) and basically i couldn't ask for a cooler boyfriend. There is only one catch. I consider myself to be a pretty sexual individual. I often let my mind wander to naughty things (mostly about my boyfriend, which i feel good about) and get excited and then want to try those things later. He, on the other hand, does none of this. At the beginning of the relationship there was slightly more sexual interaction, but almost all of it was initiated by me. Since then we've been having less and less sex because i became insecure constantly initiating it, assuming that he either doesn't find me sexually attractive anymore or he is just uninterested in general. I've tried on many occasions to ask him what he found exciting or arousing, even offering risque secrets of my own in order to make him feel more comfortable, but no matter what i do he insists that he just doesn't have any turn ons. I think he feels that he needs to repress his sexuality as a man, but he's done it to a point that he has none. We are to the point now that we have sex MAYBE once a week (we sleep in bed together around 4-6 times a week) and i just don't know what to do.

{"prompt":"Our car broke down in another state, and long story short we got jobs, found an apartment, started a new life here. \n\n  At first, I didn't have a job, and he paid for everything. Then, I got a job, worked my ass off and got promoted to full time. His contract was over and now he's looking for work again. I pay for everything now, with the deal that he will pay me back his half later. He said he would pay half of the rent out of his savings. \n  He's applied for about two hundred jobs, with no leads. He's been late giving me rent for the last two months, and he still owes me one hundred from last month.

Over the phone, i've begged him to come home- it's about 2am here- but he maintains that I just want his money, and \"everything is about money\" to me. For the record, it's not, I would pay all of the rent if he told me ahead of time he couldn't afford it.

It's actually scary to admit because I have only experienced this beginning phase of love ONCE: almost nine freaking years ago. We have been on three dates, kissed and I hope to call him my boyfriend in the future.\n\nHowever this shit is frightening me. I thought I was super experienced due to my eight year relationship but turns out I know nothing. It's been three dates and we haven't had sex. My girlfriends are telling me I am weird en prude for not having sex yet and that he'll probably won't want a fourth or fifth date. It's not even the sex itself that I am concerned about, it's the damn pill. I don't want to rely on solely a condom, but I only got off the pill three months ago and my period still isn't perfectly regular. I just don't want to fuck up my body again but maybe I should to keep him happy?\n\nAlso, when do you start thinking about being boyfriend-girlfriend? It's only been three dates over a course of 1,5 month, is that extremely short? Long? Normal?\n\nBasically I am a giant noob and need advice.","chosen":"had only one long relationship, don't know what to do with sex and being exclusive after 3 dates.

{"prompt":"So I've \"known\" this girl since like middle school, but we never talked until I started messaging her on Facebook recently. I would just spark up short conversations here and there asking her questions about our common career path of nursing.\n\nHowever, last night I actually felt like our conversation was more than what it usually is. The feeling became more friendly and informal. We talked longer than usual too and even agreed literally at one point that we should \"be friends\" and \"hangout.\" I told her we should even get lunch at one point.\n\nHere's the thing, I've been single for 2 years now and I'm a bit attracted to her. I like the idea of being platonic friends at first but I have a feeling I will unconsciously do something that will give her signals of my attraction toward her. I've been contemplating whether or not I should pay for our first lunch as well. I don't want to creep her off, so I'm not sure what I should do? Should I strictly keep it platonic?

{"prompt":"I sold my car to someone a few months back. Let's call him Bob. I signed over the title to Bob and made him sign a bill of sale\/notice of transfer. I got three copies, one of which I mailed to the tax collector's office the next day. I didn't hear anything from either the Bob or the tax collector for nearly two months. Then today, a friend of a Bob came by and said that Bob sold it to someone else, Jim. Bob never transferred thr title over to himself when he bought the car. Instead, he sold it to Jim. Jim tried to go get tags in his name, but can't because the title is still under my name. Bob and friend gave Jim my number and said that they aren't going to deal with the situation and Bob changed his number.Now Jim wants me to go with him to the DMV and sign the title over to him. That isn't legal, I think. Because I sold the car to Bob, and I already turned in the bill of sale\/notice of transfer to the tax collector So isn't this out of my control and Bob's problem?

{"prompt":"So, long story short. We've been dating almost 5 months. My boyfriend [25]had a rough upbringing and a very rough first and only relationship that ended in a divorce. \nHe's not my first relationship. I'm[21] actually a little younger and have been in about 4 (depending what you count as a relationship). His ex was super controlling so I really do my best not to be even when I feel he's out of line.\nHe feels the need to have these like little Internet friends flow over into our relationship. Like one of his online friends didn't like me and basically stopped talking to him over me. All of these \"friends\" are female of course. \nHe posts on several reddits that I don't particularly care for because of their content and doesn't understand why it bothers me. He is just complimenting these women and loves doing it. He's not trying to fuck them or anything that I know of but it makes me really insecure. I've never had a need for the attention of multiple people but he does. He basically craves it, whereas I find it childish. \nHe brags about being hit on and some of his past sexual encounters. I'm about 4-5 years younger than him but I am not less experienced and he always seems to throw the age card out when he disagrees with me. \nI'm very grown for my age. I go to college, work full time and still have a family\/ social life. I've worked for all I have actually. So when he drops that card it is extremely insulting to me. Is it wrong to tell him to stop or leave? I don't want to be belittled because I'm young.

Unfortunately, she had a past\/baggage that really affected her on a daily basis. In terms of social behaviour, she just wouldn't have fit in with my family or friends... In addition our long term goals were not the same. Problem was, I liked her a bunch and it was hard to come to grips and tell her how I really felt. In the end, I told her everything and was probably too straight forward, and really hurt her feelings... But I knew it had to be that way or it wouldn't be \"final\"...

{"prompt":"My girlfriend who I have been dating for 2 months had lost her father 5 months ago and overall very shortly before I had met her online. All in all she has not taking been taking it well as one can imagine and it's been a struggle on all fronts. The tragedy took place on the 6th of the month, 3 months prior to meeting her so it really was so fresh. IN addition to having a lot of trouble with it all and every 6th of the month is extremely difficult on her. \n\nYesterday was the 6th and after a super long and busy day I got caught up in my own plans and life. We didn't talk much that day and I had obviously forgotten the date so at the end of the day I received a nasty drunk text message from my girlfriend telling me how badly I fucked up. Sadly when she drinks she gets emotionally abusive and despite me apologizing the conversation got super heated and after a bunch of \"fuck yous\" thrown my way it was clear things were not going well. \n\nWe've had a rocky two months and this isn't the first time her alcohol tendencies tend to be taken out on me. I definitely fucked up but what happened last night was totally uncalled for and now...both of us don't know where this is all leading.","chosen":"forgot the 6th of the month, got a drunk text from my girlfriend, got yelled at, and now we're both confused and don't know where this is all going.","rejected":"I forgot the date of my girlfriend's father's death and got a drunk text from her telling me how badly I fucked up."}
{"prompt":"I'm a 15 year old girl that has liked the same boy for 3 years, passionately. However, he doesn't like me, as far as I know. I sort of asked him out before, ages ago. He said no. Back then, he was very cold to me and we were having a bad time in our friendship. We fell out, because his friends disliked me and I annoyed him or something like that. \n\nNow, he is friends with me again. We are closer. However, the way he's acting with me has changed. He sits more open and talks to me all the time, he does things to get my attention and he stares at me in the eyes while smiling at me. He'll pretend to be cold, but he'll have a little smirk on his face, but not a rude one.\n\nI like this new change. It seems he has forgotten about our argument and my love. People have mentioned it to him, he doesn't say anything. During a conversation with a group about partners and sex, he said to me that \"he might be a tiger in bed\". He's being sweeter, nicer and a little bit...cheeky.\n\nI am getting sick of lying and denying my feelings for him, I just want to tell him, but I'm scared that it will all go bad again. I'm more mature now, but I still fear rejection.\n\nWhat do you think these changes mean?

{"prompt":"So we've been together for 10 years and over this time I wouldn't say things have gone stale but it feels like nothing is spontaneous any more. For instance, she will never initiate sex which I have voiced to her over the years and I get the same answer. Time goes on and nothing has changed, I've accepted that she just isn't going to (she says she's still sexually attracted and sex is great when it happens). But when it comes to things like doing activities or certain acts she always says \"well what do I get?\", so much so that it feels like I'm with a prostitute for lack of a better term. As if I'm paying either fiscally or with another act for something I desire. This has led me to initiate less and lose interest occasionally for resenting her statement. I would say I'm not sexually greedy, I will and do please her with all the things she likes whenever possible. \n\nI've also brought this up on occasion and it feels like it falls on deaf ears. I get a blank stare and a \"okay\". Still nothing changes or occasionally she'll feel bad about it and try to initiate but it feels like a pity act rather than a consensual one. \n\nI am always asking her what she would like to do for activities or even simple things such as where she would like to eat and I always get, \"I don't know\".

{"prompt":"My boyfriend's parents live about an hour and a half away. We visit them regularly (used to be every other weekend pre-dog). Since adopting Cocoa, we have visited them 3 times (we have had her two months). She comes along. She is great in the car!\n\nThey have a dog, a 3 year old collie\/border collie cross. She's a bit neurotic and under socialized. And morbidly obese. She's nice enough I guess, and they're trying to bring down her weight, but they only recently started walking her regularly. I suspect she's pretty under exercised but she's also a pretty lazy dog (maybe because of her weight..) \n\nSo the weird bit. When Cocoa is allowed to approach Roxy after they greet\/play and Roxy is panting, she immediately goes for Roxy's tongue and mouth and tries licking\/nibbling. She does this so much that Roxy gets agitated and the bickering starts. \n\nNote that we have been pretty slow on the introductions in that we keep them separated most of the visit, let them romp outside to tucker them out off leash (they play hard, but lots of bows and positive body language, so they seem to get along), and have walked them together. They have gotten more used to each other with every visit. They just can't seem to settle when off leash around each other. They have to be physically separated or Roxy will approach Cocoa and Cocoa will keep trying to lick her. I am concerned the nibbling and subsequent romping will lead to aggression; it hasn't so far, but we separate them until they settle again. \n\nI just can't understand why Cocoa wants to lick\/nibble Roxy's tongue. She doesn't do this to dogs at the dog park. She's pretty independent and happy to leave other dogs alone. Except Roxy.

{"prompt":"A bit of backstory: \nGrew up in multiple countries as a child, my parents were rich socialites who only managed to have Sunday 'meetings\/family days' with my brother and I, otherwise we were raised by maids. At 16, my brother got sent to boarding school in a different country. I was sent to a boarding school at 18. My brother and I were never close then and the idea of family was only something we saw on tv or in movies. \nFast forward to now, I have my own life, job, engaged to be married. My brother is doing really well and has his own family and baby. We reconciled over the lack of family growing up and have a good relationship now. Our parents become nothing more than distant and inconsistent Penpals. (I would always rag on them for never giving us any updates) They live in a different country so it's difficult to even call them sometimes. \n\nAbout a year ago, I received a call from my mother (we had not spoken in years) asking for a bit of cash for an issue they had run in to. Thinking they were in need, I caved and sent them money. I later found out my brother had as well. \nA month ago, I get an email from my mother explaining that my dad has had dementia for the past 2 years, they are in legal difficulties, kicked out of their house by the bank, too poor to afford food... it goes on. My brother and I scramble and send them money. My brother even went out of his way to make sure we weren't being scammed by some distant relatives. \n\nNow I am getting weekly text messages about needing money for food when she barely ever even wished me a happy birthday in the past. They appear to have estranged themselves to their friends since when I attempt to contact any of them, I get ignored. I sent them most of my wedding savings, which I now regret but I am not sure if that makes me a bad person for not wanting to help them more.
