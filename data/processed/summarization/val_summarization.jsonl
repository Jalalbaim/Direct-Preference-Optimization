I am unable to go with him unless we are married.  \n\nTo top it all off, I was recently deployed for 6 months, and at the end of my deployment, my FH deployed to a different area.  By the time he gets back (late spring) it will have been a year since we've seen each other. \n\nAnyway, after discussion, we have decided to get married before he goes overseas.  Then, either I can try to apply to get orders with him, or I will be eligible to go be with him after my contract is up next year. \n\nHe is coming to visit me after he gets back from his deployment, and we have been discussing doing a court house marriage at that time.  The problem with this, is that both of our families would not be able to make it at that time (both his dad and my grandma are dealing with serious illnesses at this time).  We do not want to disappoint our families by getting married without them, but we absolutely cannot wait on the marriage due to the military. \n\nSo now for the advice....would we be terrible people for eloping\/doing a court house wedding by ourselves....but only announcing engagement to everyone at that time?  We would plan to do a backyard wedding in fall before he leaves so that our families would have time to plan and be there.  Would 3-4 months be enough time to plan a simple backyard ceremony\/reception?  Anybody have experience with either elopment or backyard weddings?","chosen":"military FH and I contemplating elopement\/court house wedding but not sure how long would such a wedding need to be planned in advance, would our families allow it since they would be unable to attend?","rejected":"FH leaving for overseas deployment, wanting to do backyard wedding before he leaves, unsure of how long to wait before proposing...any advice?"}
{"prompt":"2.5 year old (at the time-- she turns 3 in September) was nearly potty trained, but fully regressed to diapers when her baby brother was born. We let it rest for a couple months, but have begun working on potty training again. She starts preschool in 5 weeks and must be \"potty trained or nearly potty trained,\" otherwise she will be forced to leave. We got an amazing deal due to a need based scholarship, and so being kicked out would be very problematic, as we can't really afford preschool anywhere else (and I work part time so we need childcare regardless).\n\nShe has been doing well with potty training again-- poops and pees on the potty if we remind her, but she also will pee in her pull ups all day long and not even notice. So today we switched to full time undies so she'll notice when she's wet. We were expecting accidents, but we weren't expecting her to *enjoy* them. She has had 3 accidents today, and each time says something like \"Uh oh, something's on the floor... It's... PEE PEE!!\" Very excitedly and with a big smile on her face.\n\nWe have been making her clean the mess up as a \"natural consequence,\" but she thinks that's fun so I don't know how much of a \"consequence\" it is to her. The third time, my husband sent her to her room, essentially punishing the accident... I've heard that you shouldn't punish a child for accidents, but he thinks she's doing it on purpose. I don't necessarily think she is-- I mean, maybe she is, but maybe she really is having an actual accident and just thinks it's funny. I don't know. \n\nShe's very verbal and definitely understands that you *should* pee on the potty. She does notice when she has to go sometimes and successfully makes it to the potty. Other times we will remind her and take her to the potty, and she can pee \"on command\" upon sitting down. So I'm confident she is physically developed enough to potty train as far as communication and bladder control.\n\nThis is day one of undies, so I figured I'd get some advice here before we screw this up too badly.","chosen":"Toddler peeing on floor with enthusiasm, and makes comments like \"It's pee pee, pee pee!\" when we remind her to use the potty.

{"prompt":"This happened when I was around 12.  I found a turtle in my back yard, put it in a box, and brought it inside. From experience and from TV I had developed an understanding  that I couldn't *force* an animal to be friends with me. I felt a sense of pride in my maturity for realizing it might take time for this turtle to like me. I covered my floor in newspaper, took him out of the box. Then I went and sat on the floor across the room. I had the fanciful idea that if I was patient enough, the turtle would warm up to me even though I removed it from its natural habitat, family, friends, etc. \n\nI sat there and waited. Sure enough, the turtle began slowly crawling over to me. I was ecstatic but I sat there playing it cool for almost 45 minutes. The turtle made his way across my room inch-by-inch as I daydreamed that he actually wanted to sit in my lap, play with me, etc. \"All it took was a little patience,\" I smugly thought as the turtle finally arrived.

{"prompt":"I wanna start off with a back story. I've been overweight for as long as I can remember... I really first noticed it when I was about 9-10 years old at that point I tried to become more active but shortly lost it when my dad got a new job. Around that same time I had also expressed to my mom that I felt food was the only friend I had and was the only friend that could move with us. Fast forward to when I was a freshman in HS I became increasingly more active because I didn't have a bus to take me to school and back. At this point my mom decided to put the family on weight watchers and we got a gym membership.  I went from being 230 lbs to being 175! I felt awesome but still had a bit more to go!

{"prompt":"This story took place two years ago, a couple of months after the bike incident I had with another girl. This girl was just a friend. Being the immature teenage boy I was, I teased this girl. I remember meeting her and talking to her for a little while at an Interact service (A community service club in my high school). After a week or two with us going about our lives, I was walking down the hallway and she just saw me holding my bag of chips and was like \"You owe me chips,\" as a friendly gesture.\n\nAgain, me being the immature guy I was, I played along with it. Whenever I saw her in the hallway, I would be like \"You owe me chips!\" and she would say \"No, you owe me chips wtf.\" One day after school, I started doing this in front of her friends and embarrassed her. She thought I was just being funny and enjoyed it. One day, I bought myself a couple bags of chips and I tried giving one to her, but she rejected. Although I was pretty persistant about giving it to her, she still said no. Now that I think about it, even though she said no playfully, I now know that she was getting pretty damn annoyed.\n\nThe next day during lunch time, I walked by her table and threw the bag onto her lap. I kid you not, this girl got up and started booking it to me with the intention of trying to give it back to me, so I went along with it and started a chase. After maybe like 50 feet, I hear a slam on the ground. I look back and I saw that she ate shit, in front of 70+ other people. Her three-week old phone cracked, elbow scrapped, knee bleeding. Yeah, it was a pretty bad fall.\n\nI walked her to the nurse's office, embarrassed as hell and expecting her to yell the shit out of me, but she didn't, thankfully. I helped her clean up her wounds, bandaged them, and apologized. Since then, she hasn't said a word to me and just ignored me when she saw me. I had no game in high school as you can tell by my previous posts.","chosen":"Girl tripped and ate shit as I tried running away from her as she tried to return me a bag of chips.

He told me that he's saving money and plans on getting his own place soon. That was over 7 months ago. \nI've never seen him look for a place or a room mate or even mention it.

{"prompt":"My GF recently became my fiancee.  I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a \"$60k wedding\" and \"the groom\/his family\" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.\n\nWe can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k\/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.\n\nThe problem is that I don't want to just say \"no\" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.

I am currently in a crazy part of my schooling where I am constantly busy. She has been amazing with it, has never nagged me when all I could do was come over and study, and for that I am so grateful as school has cost me 2 relationships already.\n\nWell she has been wanting to move to a city 2 hours away from us since I met her, I just never thought it would happen this fast. I have been planning on moving to the same city for about 2 years now, just need to finish my schooling. Well she just got offered a job so will probably be moving in the next few weeks.

She's nice, pretty, and intelligent, and I do enjoy spending time with her.  We laugh and have great conversation... but as soon as we part, I feel like I'm not attracted to her, and her (perceived) flaws come rushing to the forefront of my mind:  she has a negative attitude, she has poor posture, she's too short for me, she interrupts.

I thought I'd come to terms with that and moved on months ago.  Nope.  I'm mentally comparing her to the current girl.\n\nI like this girl and really want to give her a shot, but the only time I feel attraction is when we're together and I think that's due to my own insecurity and need for physical contact.

{"prompt":"Hello \/r\/relationships, I'll try to keep this as short as I can.\n\nThree months ago, I moved into a house in England with three other people from my country, 2 girls and 2 guys (including me). I had little to no attraction to either of the girls, one was too dull to talk to properly, and the other I had little attraction to. For the sake of this story, I'll call her Liz.\n\nAll four of us are on good terms, haven't had many problems or serious rows, so we get along well. Recently (a week or two ago), however, I started to become more and more attracted to Liz - we talked a lot, discussed quite a few things, and I understood why she was the way she was (which is to say a bit unusual, she's a bit strange at times with how she behaves). With that insight into her personality, I realised that although she's not stunningly attractive, I really, really like her. I haven't felt anything like this for a while, and I genuinely don't know what to do, or whether the feeling is mutual. Yesterday we were sat in the kitchen for hours discussing love, relationships, sex, all that, and I wanted to do something right then and there.\n\nI will definitely talk to her about this, but it's a question of timing. She's leaving tomorrow morning - heading back home -, and will be back in just under a month. I don't think that now is the best time to bring this up, seeing as she's getting ready to leave, but I honestly don't know what to do.","chosen":"Moved in with roommate, thought little of her, then recently realised that I have become really attracted to her, but don't know what to do.","rejected":"I've become more attracted to my roommate than I have been for a long time.

{"prompt":"It's all very nice that people can make changes in their lives to make it go away, but for many or most, that does not help at all. If you have been feeling depressed for a time longer than six months, and\/or it interferes with your life, see a counselor AND GP. Sure, many have factors in their lives which cause them to feel this way, but many are genetically predisposed to the condition and no scenery change or 'opening up' will change that.\n\nGo to a counselor (not a psychiatrist) to determine whether your problems are psychological, and a GP to determine whether it is at all related to any physical issues that you may have (allergies, diet, et cetera). Go to a specialist at the recommendation of your counselor and GP. Starting with a specialist can be problematic, first because it may cost you unnecessarily, and second because, at least in my experience, someone who limits their field of work can sometimes limit their field of vision. Unnecessary treatment and incorrect diagnosis kind of suck. So, start out with a wide view, and work your way toward a more focused treatment.\n\nDon't just wait for it to get better, and don't expect the world to get better with a change of location.

I am convinced that even though online job sites have openings in seemingly entry level jobs, that they really aren't hiring. After checking sites like craigslist (only restaurants, everything else  on there is pretty much a scam) and Indeed.com and applying to every position that I qualified for the only place that ever called me in for an interview was McDonald's... and they didn't even hire me! I even tried through a temp agency for a while to no avail. What really pissed me off about the temp service is that the only job they ever wanted to offer me was an over-night housekeeping position at a hospital. I have experience as a housekeeper but I was being upfront and honest when I said that housekeeping isn't something I was interested in doing anymore. I suppose beggars can not be choosy though. Just as I was seriously considering this job, I saw in the newspaper (hey, I was looking in every resource I could get my hands on for a job!) that they had not only one but two ads for jobs that I would much rather do than house keep! One was an administrative job and the other was a production job. When I had called to question why they never offered those positions to me (I was very poignant and called the temp service twice a week to see what was available); they said that was just so that they could get people in to put in applications! I said, why do they need more applications when they can not even find jobs for the people that have already signed up!\n\nAnd I really want to say thanks to reddit because I did take a lot of advice here to heart.

There was already a car in the driveway dropping off another child and I didn't want to block her in, as I know the mom and I know we both have the same time requirement for when to be at school. My husband with a more flexible schedule typically drops my son off, so it's not usually a big deal to wait. Anyhoo...it's not a gated community. It's a public street. Is that even legal for this guy to call and harass her? (Apparently this has happened with other parents and I mean, dude, get a life. Like does he stare out his window and just look for cars parked on the street? He must have. Total glassbowl, apparently.) Add to this the fact that there are *always* work trucks parked on the street because they're doing someone's lawn, or it's someone's housecleaning service. Right, OK, so it's cool for lawn guys to park huge-ass trucks on the street for hours at a time but my 4 door sedan being parked for less than 2 minutes is a crisis. \n\nHe apparently threatened to call the county to complain about her not paying proper taxes (which she does) and all kinds of other nonsense. Seriously, he's off his rocker about this. But is it legal? He's a realtor, so his info is publicly available. I really want to contact him and tell him that if my car is so terribly inconveniencing to him, he should speak to *me* about it instead of cowering behind stupid threats and harassing a sweet woman who watches babies all day.","chosen":"Daycare provider is being harassed by idiot for parking on street for 108 seconds.

{"prompt":"Throwaway here. To give a little back story, November 27 I was terminated from my job.  The reasons were something similar to \"this isn't working out\" \"We've had some attendance issues\" and a few other various things seem to be thrown in there.  The main reason I was probably fired was due to (*speculation*) not working overtime and lack of work coming up.    \n  \nShort version:  I requested PTO and was approved before thanksgiving, I was told to work 10-6 the sat and sun before thanksgiving week.  I had previously worked both weekends, along with my 40hr weeks, and this time I told them no, I already had plans and requested thanksgiving week off.  Tuesday after thanksgiving week I was fired.  I was told it was my last day but I would be kept on payroll and be compensated through Dec 31, and so technically I was still employed.\n\nAfter that point I spent my time job searching.  I applied to a job on the 17th which I was contacted about on Jan 2, the company recruiter passed my info along to the hiring manager and they decided they wanted to interview me today.  I completely forgot I had not updated my resume and nothing ever came up about \"current\" job or \"do you still work here\" so I never really had a chance to insert it and honestly I was so focused on making a good impression and what I could bring to the company it passed my mind.\n\nSo I choose to follow up with an email a few hours later because my gf asked if they asked about being fired and I had already worked up how I would discuss it. I felt like a complete dumbass for excluding it.  The email was an interview thank you follow up and I inserted a paragraph about them not having an updated resume and I did not want to misrepresent myself and my employment ended Dec 31. If they had questions to contact me.  Was this bad or am I completely screwed either way?

Every few months or so i get a flare up of pain that puts me on my arse for two or three days. About a month ago i had one of these flare ups and it hasn't gone away. for a whole month. Pain doesn't describe it properly. Finger curling, screaming agony comes close.\n\nI can't stand up, i can barely walk. Sitting down hurts, standing up hurts, lying down hurts. I went to a doctor yesterday who flipped and said I need to get an MRI immediately. She wouldn't even let me walk out of the surgery and called a taxi. She faxed a referral to a neurosurgeon and said to wait for his call. I waited 24 hours.

The emails included pictures of her in a sexual nature. We fought and he told me his reason for doing it was that we hadn't had sex yet and he was horny. \n\nThe reason we hadn't had sex yet was because I was not on birth control and he had never said anything about wanting to so I thought it wasn't that big of a deal.

I always found his sister attractive but it didn't develop into a full blown crush until last year. She had just graduated high school, and I'm blown away. Not only is she attractive, but she's also extremely smart. So I asked my friend to help me out with her. He said he didn't care, but it seems like out of all our friends, he'd be most comfortable with me dating her. However, all he did was just tell his family and her what I say on a daily basis. Most of it is me busting his chops, like \"I'm going to be your brother-in-law\" or \"Your sister is the most beautiful person in the world\".\nEventually, she found out, and it seemed like she's cool with it. She always says hi and smile whenever we see each other, but lately it's been awkward. Whenever I visit her house, her aunt (who lives there) would whistle whenever I'm around. (Not to be arrogant, but I am pretty fit... and seeing as how I live in California, I'm mostly wearing tank tops and short shorts lol) The mom and sisters would also do that \"wooing\" sound like the kids would do in elementary school. I admit it's nice to know that everyone finds me attractive and they like the idea of me dating her, but she gets embarrassed whenever I'm around and sometimes she ends up going to her room. I have no opportunity to actually talk to her. To make matters worse, she's only there on the weekends because she goes to a college that's an hour away.\nOverall, her entire family is clearly supportive. Her mother and step-father both love me. Her aunt might even have a crush on me tbh (she's in her late twenties). And most importantly, her brother is either pretending to not care, or he is ok with the idea of it. I just have no clue how to ask her out, or even sneak in a conversation with her. To make matters worse (or better?), she's never had a boyfriend. What should I do in this situation? Is this even a good situation?","chosen":"My [20M] friend's sister [18F] is really nice and she's 18 years old. I have no idea how to ask her out or even talk to her.","rejected":"Me [20 M], my friend's sister [18F] feeling awkward. My friend's family loves me, but my sister's family seems to dislike me.

{"prompt":"So I have a roommate who always asks me & our other roommate for rides. Her boyfriend is one of our good friends and he's always over at our place. She treats him like shit and we always feel bad for him; usually I end up trying to defend him or something. She is also rude to the rest of us (boyfriend definitely gets most of it though). She takes forever to wash her dishes and when she does, there is still fucking food on them, so I ended up re-washing them and now I got so fed up I finally moved my plates and stuff to a separate place. I want to just straight up tell her she's being a shitty person (and this is why I will not give her anymore rides or any help) but I still have to live with her for another 6 months. Any advice?","chosen":"shitty roommate, how can I tell them that I never want to help them because they're shitty (in a tactful way, since I'm stuck for another 6 months). or any other advice you have!","rejected":"Roommate treats Boyfriend like shit. I had enough of it and moved my dishes to a different place. She's still taking shit from other people (us & her boyfriend)."}
{"prompt":"So this happened a few weeks ago on my holiday to India. Back story: Indian toilets don't usually have toilet paper and are more often than not simply a hole in the ground that you squat over. I went to deposit a particularly nasty load of liquid shit or what the locals refer to as \"Delhi belly\". I'd also recently been given some very expensive glasses by my parents and was under pain of death not to lose them. So I was squatting down unleashing this never ending torrent of diarrhoea when my glasses dropped off my head and fell down the hole. In a state of blind panic and fear I shoved my hand into the bottomless pit of shit in an attempt to find my glasses and, after dipping my arm elbow-deep in shit, eventually discovered them and pulled them out. As they were covered in shit I didn't put them on and instead stumbled around outside half blind to find somewhere to wash them off, finding a small shack surrounded by what I assumed was a queue of people with a huge urn of water inside. Pushing through the crowd, I quickly rinsed my shit covered arm and glasses in this urn of cold water, returned the glasses to their rightful place and, feeling rather pleased with my lucky escape, strolled outside. I then realised my FU....the queue was full of people holding various jugs and cups and a sign on the shack read \"DRINKING WATER\" in bright red bold letters.","chosen":"Toilet shit filled glasses, I accidentally cleaned them in urn of cold water in a queue of people drinking from the same urn.","rejected":"had a shitload of shit in my glasses and drenched them in water in order to clean them.

{"prompt":"I have been in a serious relationship with my best friend for the past 6 years now. Lets call him Mr Deer. Everything about him is great, hes kind, hes supportive, sweet, caring, kinda romantic in his weird way but nonetheless, hes great.\n\nThe thing about him is that hes too passive. Sure, he holds me when we go out, gives me plenty of kisses, gives me sweet loving sex. But he just doesnt seem to hold any sort of aggression. Hold it, i know its a good thing. The thing is, i love rough sex. Spanking, domination, Whips and just all round rough sex. Think 50 Shades of Grey without the bad literature. I did talk to him about it, but he just cant bring himself to do it. Its really sweet, but sex in the bedroom is getting quite boring.\n\nI met a new guy a year back and we have been chatting recently. Well, yeah you guessed it. Hes a kind of a bad boy. Unlike Mr Deer, hes quite the manly man. Muscles, the great hair- just imagine a lion. yeah. hes quite like that. After dating a passive male for the past 6 years, i was drawn to him like a moth to a flame. For the whole year, we have been talking on and off, but the UST (underlying sexual tension for those people who dont know) Has been super intense and one day i did the unthinkable and i slept with Mr Lion. but OH MY GOD. it was the best sex i ever had.\n\nThe thing is, i never really was ready for a serious relationship but somehow Mr Deer and i just kinda escalated way too fast. I honestly dont think things would work out with Mr Lion.

{"prompt":"I really loved my girlfriend. I did. We were best friends.\n\nBut I'm having a ton of trouble reconciling that I met her so early on in life. She's my first serious relationship, and we talked about getting married etc. She's on-board with the idea, and I just couldn't continue the relationship because I wasn't sure.\n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is whether or not I'm ok with settling down so early. I already feel like maybe I'm missing something. All my friends have gone on streaks of dating a lot, nothing serious, and a lot of flings. I've never had that in life. I always was looking for a relationship. But now that I have one, I feel trapped. I feel that if I commit to this now, I'm giving up the chance to ever be able to have that fun freedom in my 20s. Part of me wants to experience that, but on the other hand what if I'm letting the best one go just to go experience shitty relationships?\n\nI always thought that I'd end up with a physically fit, active girl. My girlfriend simply isn't. She's never done any real physical activity, and doesn't have much urge to do so. I still find her attractive, but I'm worried that she'll gain weight the older she gets. I know that beauty fades with age... but I still want to be crazy attracted to her. I am attracted to her now more just because of our relationship than her physical appearance. If she did lose a bit of weight and was active, I know she would be that crazy hot girl I've always wanted... but I can't force her to become active, and I also don't want to bank on that happening.\n\nI'm just really caught up in \"what-if\"s right now, and it's killing me inside.

{"prompt":"For almost all my post-high school life, I've been single or at the most simply dated. There were a myriad if reasons for this, but for the most part, it never bothered me. \n\nI started dating my current gf 14 months ago, although we worked together and had been acquaintances for approx 3 years before we started dating. She knew who I was and seems to accept my habits like the fact that I smoke pot each night, dedicate alot of time to my new profession as a brewer, watch sports all the time, etc. \n\nNow that we're living together, I can't help but think I may have made a mistake. We get along great and aren't constantly fighting. But part of me still can't shake this feeling of, \"what the hell have I gotten myself into?\".\n\nFor example, my gf is very picky about certain things around the house and for the most part I'm not, but when I do assert myself she gets pretty bent out of shape very easily. She'll get over it quickly when I explain why it's not a big deal, but the fact that she gets all pissy for 10-15 minutes about me wanting to add more pasta sauce to MY raviolis concerns me as it seems like the kind of thing that doesn't warrant a second thought. \n\nThis kind of stuff doesn't happen all the time, but I'm noticing that she sweats the small stuff too much in general, gets stressed out easily it seems and kinda shuts down (quiet, not very responsive, seems sad).

I didn't think anything of it at the time, so I said yes.\n\nWell, that's when he starts ending all of his texts with smiley faces and winks.

I didn't want to get involved.  But after they left I came out to clean some tables thinking the coast was clear.  She came back in for something.

{"prompt":"A little background: I (M 31) met up with a woman my age a few months ago in a class we were taking in preparation for going to the university (yes, a bit late for both of us, different topic). We got along *really* well and she ended up confessing to me and we became a couple. There was a catch: She is married and they have a kid, but her husband is abusive and she has been planning on leaving him. Because I didn't want to be a \"pulling factor\" on her relationship more than I already was, we agreed on keeping it FWB.\n\nObviously we fell head over heels for eachother, though her moreso than I, I think. Yesterday she started fishing for what I would do if I could choose and if it was up to me, and I suspect she wanted me to say she should leave her husband. I said that ideally, I wish she managed to get things working with her husband and for their kid's sake, and maybe I could find someone who could measure up to her. Perharps not the most elegant way of putting it, but it's what I said in the moment as I still thought we were keeping it casual FWB. It was then it became more apparent how attached to me she was as she was absolutely devastated.\n\nA second catch: We have both signed up for a year-long class this year, related to the one we met in. It's too late for any of us to change or go to a different place.\n\nHonestly I would be fine just distantiating myself while being around her. I care for her a lot but have managed to keep it FWB and would be fine degrading it to just friends again. It's different for her though.

That was about 4 months ago. \n\nFlash forward to now. After that didn't work out, I started going on casual dates and meeting new people. I actually found I really enjoyed it. It gave me space to focus on schoolwork (I'm an engineering major and have 3 jobs on campus so I'm pretty busy) and an openness in my social life.

{"prompt":"I'm using a throwaway because my girl will go on reddit sometimes.  Title pretty much says it all.\n\nWe've been together for about a year and a half.  The first year was great, we lived close to each other and spent most of our time together.  Then she had to move with her parents ten hours away from everything she's ever known.  So we've spent the last six months long distance.  She started school and everything was going well for the most part.  We've had our issues here and there but we've mostly worked through them.  Things have still been pretty good despite our random arguments.  I would say we're both a little over protective of one another, probably even more so now that we're about 500 miles apart.  And here's where I need advice.  She recently started talking with one of the guys in her class and they want to get together and work on a take-home test with each other.  Because of my past, I've had some trust issues and this situation seems all too familiar with me.  Previous ex went and \"studied\" which really was just her studying the guys dick.  So because of this, I'm feeling uncomfortable with my girlfriend going and studying with this new guy she met.\n\nI understand deep down that my fears are irrational and its not fair to her to compare her to my ex.  I want to be okay and be care-free about who my girlfriend hangs out with and stuff but I'm just uncomfortable with it all.  It's really consumed my thoughts for the past few days since she told me about what she was going to do.  I feel that if she was going to study with a girl, I'd be perfectly fine with it, but since its a guy, I  feel uncomfortable.  I would never tell her to not go and study with him because I don't want to be that guy and that would probably only push her away.  So how do I overcome these thoughts about what could happen?  How do you be comfortable with this?  I feel that these are probably my insecurities talking, so what do you do to become more secure?","chosen":"Girlfriend wants to study with a guy she met during school and I am uncomfortable with it.

{"prompt":"I meet this girl 6 months ago. It had taken me some time to get her number but from our very first date everything was magic. She was reserved throughout mostly but at the end of the night after a little dancing I went in for the kiss. It was a first date but it went through quite nicely. Days later we spoke about the kiss and she said it was something she didn't do. She said that she wasn't like that and that she was a good girl. I said fine. That gave me confidence that I was unique while also instilling in my mind that this girl has some virtue to her(which to me is good). 2 weeks pass and we have sex. 2 months pass I'm in love. 3 months later she drops a massive bomb on me.\nShe tells me that she was traveling the world for some time and she would sleep with random guys a lot. It got so much that she was one week having sex with 3 different guys. I felt like all the stuff she told me about {she doesn't kiss on the first date and she's a good girl} were disingenuous. She even told me she was having unprotected sex with one guy because he refused to wear condoms and she just kept sleeping with him ( while sleeping with the others too).

It started in university and since me and my girlfriend are both studying away from home, the relationship becomes long distance during summer and winter  holidays. We tend to fight a lot more during this time, for example we haven't texted for two weeks.\n\nNow my best friend, I've known for around almost 6 years but haven't spent as many of those years with her due to studying abroad. However, when I come back home for summer break or winter break, we meet up and catch up. Everyone  always told me that she's into Mr and said we should be a couple , friends family, but I never saw it and neither of us have ever brought up the topic with one another.\n\nLast winter break, I came home and my family went to meet my best friends family since they live in a different city. We ended up spending the night there and  I hadn't seen her for two years at this point. That was the first time I felt something towards her. \n\nFast foward to today, my sister's wedding was yesterday and since my best friend is also sort of a family friend, we've been meeting up alot more then usual, and my feelings for her have escalated like crazy. However I'm heading back for university in 2 weeks and I want to tell her how I feel, but I'm still in a relationship even though we haven't texted in weeks. I can't bring myself to end it over texts, and I can't bring myself to tell my best friend how I feel while being in a relationship.

{"prompt":"So I recently moved to a new school and on my second day, met a girl who shall here forth be called \"Kim\". We became fast friends and I realized that was I was starting to develop feelings for her, but these feelings were stronger than I had ever had for anybody before. I was going a little out of my mind keeping my feelings for her in, and finally on Friday I told her my feelings and she essentially said that she gets it, whatever, and we carried on as usual. This was fine with me, and we actually talked all day Saturday. However, on Sunday she ignored me, and today she's been scattered in replying to my texts and other attempts to communicate. This is my first point. My second, is that after I started talking to Kim, she introduced me to her best friend, who we shall now call \"Ruby\". So I was pining after Kim, but at the same time I really wanted to make a connection with Ruby. We shared a lot more interests, but I still had stronger feelings for Kim. Now, when I was going crazy, Ruby really helped me out and gave me good advice. She has consistently given me good advice and been really helpful at any moment in our friendship. Once I told Kim about my feelings, she started to stand out to me. Ruby seemed so... different then. I realized that this entire time, I've tried to repress any feelings I had for her, as I didn't want anyone other than Kim. I have such a different feeling towards Ruby though. With Kim, just talking to her makes me happy, but whenever we fall out of contact, I just start to get deep emotional pain. But I can't really put a finger on my feelings for Ruby. She makes me happy, and I feel such a need to make her happy and protect her from anything.

{"prompt":"We were dating for 8 months when last month she started to get withdrawn and more insecure with us. It seems she'd get upset with me at the drop of a hat. \n\nThree weeks ago we had the talk. She said it'd be best for us to go on a break for now and she's not ready for any sort of relationship. Initially I fought back, because I love her. I said we could work on it, etc. Was not having it, said she just wasn't ready. \n\nSince then we still talk every day but significantly less. Today she let it slip that she's been having a very bad episode of depression in an unrelated context to our relationship. \n\nBasically, I'm asking if I should pursue her still. IE remind her I'm not going to abandon her because of depression, how much I care for her, etc etc. I feel conflicted. On one hand, she told me wasn't ready and I really want to respect her boundaries for obvious reasons. On the other hand, since it is depression I'm not sure if she knows what she *really* wants and if stepping away would be best. \n\nI'm thinking if she really wanted nothing more to do with me, we wouldn't talk as much as we do, even at the limited rate it is. I've given her opportunities for a NC break. \"If you think it's best to stop talking and go our separate ways, you just need to say\" etc stuff like that. \n\nP.S. I'm feeling a bit insecure today about it, a \"friend\" of mine brought up that it could just be an excuse to sleep around since she said \"break\" and that must translate to promiscuity.

{"prompt":"**Background**: I have been dating my girlfriend for 6 months. Things were going pretty well. We got along well, sex was pretty good, we met each other's families, and we get along with each others friends pretty well.\n\n**Issue**: We have openly talked about how we are not super attracted to each other. Neither of us has the impulse to just tear the clothes off the other. Despite that, our sex is usually pretty good. Lately, I have noticed myself \"just going through the motions\" when being intimate with her. I should mention that my girlfriend is overweight and I am not. She is not super obese or anything, but she is overweight by the BMI definition. I am not overweight. She tore her ACL playing softball a year ago. I thought maybe she would lose the extra pounds after her knee healed, but this has not happened. She has mentioned that she wants to shed the extra pounds. However, her actions don't follow through on this. She skips workouts, doesn't seem to have a lot of portion control (she doesnt eat giant portions, but I've never heard her say 'no thanks. I'm on a diet'), and I she recently laughed about eating a can of pringles. So I think this is contributing to my lack of attraction to her. Also, I think I have some issues about thinking of other women. I haven't slept with a lot of girls in my life (like 3) and I constantly wonder if I could maybe have a few flings and then settle down. I know that sounds bad but its true...\n\n**Current Status**: I felt strongly about talking to her today about how I have been feeling. I asked her how she felt things were going. She didn't say a whole lot. I told her I haven't felt too romantic towards her lately and that I know I like her, but maybe not in a romantic sense. I didn't come out and say the weight thing is an issue. That's hard for me to do because I know she's had a previous eating disorder. Anyways, we're on a break now. I feel lonely, but I don't think that's a great reason to go back to her.","chosen":"Been seeing my girlfriend for 6 months. I have been feeling a little unresponsive to her.

In our college's honor program enjoying life and utilizing my brain to the highest capacity. I've met some really cool people over the couple years at my college.

It's pretty understandable.\n\nShe has a sister and I can sense that she really likes me! 0.o.

However after that he told me something that worried me; apparently when we first met he hated me as he felt i was stealing his best friend (who is now my best friend) and he has had those types of feelings for all his previous best friends. It worries me because he appears to be very possessive towards his best friends and he wants to keep them all to himself.\n \nhe has also done a number of creepy things like asking a female friend of ours to let him sleep in her bed with her and cuddle. He has also joked about raping me a lot over the few years we were best friends and i always thought he playing up to the fact that everyone at our school called us gay or maybe he liked making uncomfortable jokes like that. \n\nThroughout most of our friendship he has wanted to sleep with me and this is a dude that i have shared bedrooms with and now i'm scared that he may have done something creepy while i was asleep. I can't trust him anymore. \n\nThis entire altercation has also split our very close group of friends apart and i need some unbiased opinions on what actions to take as i'm now having to try and convince my friends that i'm not homophobic or a liar.

{"prompt":"I lost my virginity two weeks ago to the most wonderful man I have ever met, and he has no idea that I was a virgin before that night. \n\nI had never seen a man naked, had never intimately touched a man, or been touched like that myself!  I thought that I would be found out after the deed, but he thinks that I am great in bed!! (Thanks r\/sex for the great guides and advice)\n\nWe have been close friends for over a year and during that time I lied to him about past boyfriends by saying that my longest relationship was 18 months (it was 3 months) and by telling him that I lived with someone for 6 months (I have never shared my home with anyone).\nI also told him that I have been with 6 people, because I was so very ashamed to be a virgin at my age. My family and friends have never found out. I have only admitted it to a therapist once and I broke down in tears as I said it.

{"prompt":"I (22 F) have been with my boyfriend (20 M) for about a year.\n\nRecently, we have been talking and he is starting to feel emotionless (says he can't control it and doesn't know anything that will help make it go away) and told me he wants to give our relationship some time to see if things can improve before we end up breaking up.\n\nEver since we've had this talk (about a week ago), I have been feeling very out-of-sorts. I have put a lot of effort into this relationship and I love him and don't want to end it. I can't help but be paranoid all the time that he is going to break up with me and worry about our relationship.\n\nSo I ask, first: what are some things that he can do to avoid losing all emotions and become (basically) a hermit, and then end up shutting me out of his life? Second: How can I stop worrying that this is definitely going to happen? I literally can't stop thinking about it and it has been interfering with my daily life. I find myself feeling nauseous, don't want to eat, getting headaches, and even just breaking down and crying.\n\nI don't want to feel this way anymore but I don't want to lose him either.

{"prompt":"So my boyfriend and I met online about a year and a half ago. For half a year we skyped everyday and got to know each other. He flew out to meet my family before I decided to move in with him in a different state. Things went really well. We fought a lot in the beginning of our relationship but we grew a lot together and fell deeply in love. However, while we became too comfortable with each other, our financial situation has been declining in a bad way. We decided to call some family for a little extra help. My boyfriend spoke to his grandmother because they're really close. Her reaction was a bit different than expected, she told us if we wanted her help, my boyfriend would have to go back to his home state and prove himself in a sense. And that left me with no choice but to do the same thing and go back to my hometown. Now I feel like we were just hitting the peak of our relationship, we just celebrated one year together. The benefits of this are that, when we are together again we will hopefully have a house, we will be much more independent and hopefully more financially responsible. But I've never had to deal with something like this. It feels like a tidal wave. It almost doesn't feel like it's really happening. To top it off, o have to stay in his apartment five more days and the utilities were just shut off. So my question is how do you redditors deal with long distance relationships? I would do anything to be with this man. I keep telling myself it is only temporary but nothing feels the same without him here. I'm sure this sounds whiny and sad but that's because well, I am whiny and sad among 3 million other emotions.

{"prompt":"I've a huge crush on this one girl who is way out of my league.\n\nWe've met maybe twice last year, talked on facebook quite a bit, but she had a boyfriend, so I kind of abandoned all hope. \n\nThis year, however, we went to a concert together in March, and she broke the news to me that they aren't together anymore. We've met once again a month ago, and spent almost the whole day together. Nothing intimate has come out of it. These were the only few successful attempts to meet with her-there were plenty invitations that she dismissed (although mostly for legitimate reasons.)\n\nSo, here's where I decided to try a little ploy: I purposefully put myself in a position where I needed her specific skills to get me out of it. And she did help me out a few times, at first. But then I got too needy, and she outright refused to help me. Now, I don't know what to do.

{"prompt":"My GF recently became my fiancee.  I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a \"$60k wedding\" and \"the groom\/his family\" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.\n\nWe can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k\/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.\n\nThe problem is that I don't want to just say \"no\" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.  For example, we live in an old, cheap apartment, and she recently bought a used car.\n\nWhat can I do here?  Advice from people with non-American partners is particularly appreciated","chosen":"Fiancee wants an expensive wedding, possibly for cultural reasons, and I think we can be happy with less.

{"prompt":"I [25F] met my friend [30F] last year, and quickly realized that her relationship that I assumed was healthy (we have mutual friends) is really codependent and toxic.

A few of our mutual friends think it is abusive.\n\nI was really happy to be friends with her, until her drunken boyfriend lashed out at me for no reason. He randomly started telling me I was a worthless person. I'm sure he was just jealous she had a friend. I managed to be patient with the scenario since I wanted her to have support, but eventually I was too blunt about my disapproval which upset her, and our relationship kind of faded out.\n\nI'm not sure what to do. I valued her as a friend, and at the least would like to be supportive. But I think her boyfriend is an abusive asshole.

However, although I agreed to still be friends with her, I still have strong latent feelings for her. I have attempted \"No Contact\" a few times but keep getting drawn back into texting\/messaging her. Every now and again I will feel like I'm over it only to see her around, get a text or be at a party\/gathering with her and have everything rush back.\n\nI'm sick of this, and so have resolved to bite the bullet and confess that I am still attracted to her, and, though I'm aware that at the moment she just wants to be alone and be friends, its not something I can change for now.\n\nI don't, however, know how to approach this. I obviously shouldn't (and don't plan to) do this over text or messaging. However I also feel a phonecall would be too impersonal and wouldn't get my point across properly.

This sounds bad but it actually gets worse.\n\nWe've talked about guys before and I've never been thrilled with the people she's dated but this takes the cake. She hasn't told me everything, but what she has makes me very concerned. She says that she's in love with a married man.

He keeps saying he's going to and keeps trying to get reassurance that my sister will be there if he makes it official. \n\nThis \"great\" guy also offered to give her a child but to not marry her. This blows my mind. This guy sounds like a loser and somehow my sister isn't seeing this. The fact that he's cheating on his wife and the fact that my sister is often deployed in the Navy, which means she's not home for stretches at a time, makes me think that she's just his relationship on the side. \n\nI see a huge train wreck coming and I love my sister, but I don't know how to approach it without setting her on the defensive. She often believes that her opinion are right and everyone else's is wrong. I know I can't stop her actions, but I want to try and help her. I know anything I might say probably won't make a difference, but I have to try. She's my older sister and I love her, but she's always had issues with guys, probably stemming to the fact that her biological father abandoned her and my mother. \n\nSo.. any ideas on what to say?

Today I was supposed to meet up and have lunch with another guy I met on Tinder, so I told my mum I was having lunch with a boy in the city. I was contemplating just saying I was having lunch with friends, but decided to tell her i was going with a boy, but not that I met him online. Then I realised that i made a massive mistake, as now I have practically dug a grave for myself, when i told her I met him locally when he actually lives nearly and hour and a half away, and became really evasive about other details.

There have been a few ups and downs in our relationship- mainly I have an issue with him drinking and cheating on me in the past (it happened twice). He had a rough life growing up and not the greatest role models or guidance, so his coping skills occasionally include drinking, which really bugs me. I encouraged him to seek counseling instead of drinking and he did for a while, but then stopped. Also the cheating was very early on in the relationship and then once last year. He was extremely tearful and apologetic, so I (maybe naively?) forgave him.\n\nSo, fast forward to now. Things have been really great or so I've thought. He hasn't drank in at least 8 months and has been really taking care of his health. Until tonight I thought we were really happy. I was woken up to him being loud on the phone and I got up to ask him to be quiet. When I saw him I knew instantly he was drunk. We got in an argument and I shut down and left the room crying. He followed me and by this time he was also crying and saying he just \"didn't think he could do it anymore.\" And that he's not sure if it's the right thing to do. I asked why  and basically he said because he's never seen a successful marriage (true) and that \"someone better might come along.\" \n\nI am so heart broken.

He told me that he's saving money and plans on getting his own place soon. That was over 7 months ago. \nI've never seen him look for a place or a room mate or even mention it.

{"prompt":"Obligatory this was when I was in high school. \n\nSo, for those of you who don't know, in Boston there's a shopping area called Haymarket. To all the tourists in the area, it's just Faneuil Hall, which is the crazy cramped food court building in the center of the area. You can get all kinds of foods there, ranging from Irish pub to mediocre Chinese food to sushi to Gelato. My personal favorite is currently the mac and cheese shop, but that's not the point.\n\nWhen I was in high school and come into Boston on my own, I would always make a bee line to the Greek shop in Faneuil Hall.

I bounced up and down in excitement, gave them some money (and told them to keep the change! I'm a good person!) And bounced upstairs to eat lunch with a spoon.

I, in turn, enjoy trolling him back. Recently, he received a dare to post something serious to his facebook as part of a prank. The way the prank works is that if somebody messages you about the serious thing you posted, you are given something by them to post on your wall. The joke spreads around like that, and is sort of stupid in my opinion. A few days later, I see he has posted to his wall \"My Grandmother went to heaven today.\" With the odd wording, and me hearing nothing of his grandma's ill health, I assumed it was another one of his prank posts to lure more people in to his silly joke. I thought it would be rather funny to mess with some of the believers in the comments of the post.\n\nI type \"Good riddance\" into the comments and, within seconds, I receive a reply from one of his friends I did not know saying \"That's horrible. Why would you say something like that?\" With a lack of better judgement, I decide not to hold back. I go on a rant spreading lies about his grandmother: \"She was a horrible person and a menace to society\", \"She even ran over my cat and never apologized\", \"I went to AssHat's house and saw alot of German WWII related items.\", \"That monster was literally a nazi!\", \"She's scum of the earth and we're better off without her.\"\n\nI felt pretty accomplished with my trolling, not even considering the possibilty his grandmother could have actually died. Later that night, I returned to facebook only to see my comments had been deleted, and AssHat's comment about the awful things I had said. Turns out his Grandmother had actually died that day, and I was the worst best friend in the world.

I can't figure out where it is because the flash was on the the room behind him in the pictures is dark. I know that we were together when the photo was taken because he wasn't that muscular before we started dating. \n\nI asked him about it and he swears that I took the picture and it was taken in our old apartment. I know it was a long time ago but I am certain that I didn't take the picture. There's no metadata for me to see what kind of camera it was taken on or anything so it's just his word against mine.

I also barely ever used his camera because I liked mine more. \n\nIt's been bothering me a lot and I can't stop thinking about it. I asked him last night if it's possible anyone saw him naked and took a picture and he said no at first but later said that maybe his old college friend (who is a woman) took it when he was changing, but he doesn't remember if he was ever naked around her. It seems very clear to me that he wasn't changing in that photo, he has a huge boner and is holding it. And even if he was just changing, why would he be doing that in front of her? \n\nI used to be so insecure about their friendship because she seemed like she was really into him but he swore nothing ever happened between them so I eventually learned to live with it.

The backyard ends with woods and hiking trails. \n\nAnyways, my 80 year old aunt said she had a litter of kittens living underneath her porch. The only human contact they had was her feeding them in the morning, which she couldn't afford to do for much longer. My sister and I went on July 14 and spent an hour luring one into a cat carrier. We surprised our mom and she was not too happy at first. Neither our mom, nor the kitten, would talk to us for 2 days haha. We discussed that the kitten was mine. I would be taking care of him and he'd be coming with me to my new apartment. Things got much better after 3 days. We discovered he was a boy kitty and I named him Caesar (I studied in Rome). He quickly became very sociable with humans and you could never tell he was ever feral. \n\nMy mom has had two male yellow Labradors since 2003 and a female cat since 2005. Caesar was scared of the dogs at first but now they love each other. The cat is another story. Caesar is a tiny energetic fur ball and always wants to play. He charges straight at her and she's just not about that life. They've never physically fought but she does hiss when he's nearby. For 10 years she always liked to go outside during the daytime to hunt smaller animals and chill with the dogs. I let her out yesterday morning and she hasn't been back since.

Days later we spoke about the kiss and she said it was something she didn't do. She said that she wasn't like that and that she was a good girl. I said fine. That gave me confidence that I was unique while also instilling in my mind that this girl has some virtue to her(which to me is good). 2 weeks pass and we have sex. 2 months pass I'm in love. 3 months later she drops a massive bomb on me.\nShe tells me that she was traveling the world for some time and she would sleep with random guys a lot. It got so much that she was one week having sex with 3 different guys. I felt like all the stuff she told me about {she doesn't kiss on the first date and she's a good girl} were disingenuous. She even told me she was having unprotected sex with one guy because he refused to wear condoms and she just kept sleeping with him ( while sleeping with the others too). She even made it a point to sleep with him one more time before leaving that particular country. What would you do or think about this situation. I'm at a loss and my brain is fucked behind thinking about it.","chosen":"The girl I'm in love with was revealed as a slut I don't know what to do now.","rejected":"girl poses as virtuous (I don't do that type) guy falls in love then months later girl tells guy she was a massive international sperm toilet for guys who she calls \"gross\" while traveling"}
{"prompt":"Some backstory first, when I was younger (14-16) I wasn't really a \"good\" kid. I was smoking and had a lot of friends who were in gangs or that were beating people up for money. And at some point one of my friends took me with him to one \"job\", I didn't know what we were doing because at first he only said he needed some help but I realized later when I entered a dark street that something was going down. So we did that \"job\" and fro  that point on my life changed completely, I started helping as many friends as I could with the fights and they were asking for help because I can hold my own in a fight (trained mma for 5 years). Just a little clarification, when I said beating peopme up for money I don't mean robbing them. Whenever someone that we knew wanted to beat a guy or more up he called us and after it was done he would give us money.\n\nNowadays I'm completely different, at 16 I moved to another country and I realized how bad I was falling and how lucky I was with the moving. When I think about the things I've done I'm disguted and hate myself for it but that won't change anything. The only problem now is that 3 months ago I've started talking to a girl and we've been together ever since and last night someone from my past decided to make a joke and write to her on facebook that if she knew everything she wouldn't like me anymore. She told me about the message and she is supposed to come over tonight to talk about what that means. I'm afraid that if she learns the truth she is going to break up and I don't want to lose her.

{"prompt":"Broke up with my ex boyfriend of 10 years about 4.5 months ago. I found out about 1.5 weeks ago he has been dating someone new for a couple of months- they aren't official yet but it's only a matter of time.\n\nPrior to me knowing this I had been doing reasonably well, I was going about my life almost as normal and was using the time to rediscover myself after being in a relationship so long. I had heard he was doing the same, and I was proud of him because when we ended things we both talked about it and agreed this was a good time for us to both do so. He had also made it clear to me that I was the one he wanted to end up with, and the idea of likely getting back together with him was something I was working towards.\n\nSince I found out about this new girl I can barely breathe. I have been crying constantly, have been psychosomatising and feeling nauseous often, and I started to have panic attacks at work. I can't concentrate on anything and have felt demotivated in almost everything. \n\nI spoke to him about it and it was good for closure but awful to hear how distant he is now- he has very much moved on from me and is very into this new girl.\n\nHe was my first boyfriend. I am afraid I will never be happy again, and that I will never find anyone that makes me as happy as he did.

Then today, a friend of a Bob came by and said that Bob sold it to someone else, Jim. Bob never transferred thr title over to himself when he bought the car. Instead, he sold it to Jim. Jim tried to go get tags in his name, but can't because the title is still under my name. Bob and friend gave Jim my number and said that they aren't going to deal with the situation and Bob changed his number.Now Jim wants me to go with him to the DMV and sign the title over to him. That isn't legal, I think. Because I sold the car to Bob, and I already turned in the bill of sale\/notice of transfer to the tax collector So isn't this out of my control and Bob's problem?

{"prompt":"Dated my ex for about a year, we went on a few trips together, met each other's family and friends, and essentially lived together for a short period. I was going through some big changes with graduating college and finding a job that was fulfilling for me- my hopes and dreams were a bit unrealistic, and I only worked on and off during college so it was a stressful transition. Anyway, I leaned too much on him for emotional support because we were always around one another and I didn't consider the amount of strain it would put on the relationship. We had other problems, namely expectations of his friends and family. I'm kind of a proponent of the idea that expectations skew reality, but whatever, people still see what they're primed to see.\n\nI think we both wanted to take the relationship to the next level but the reality is that we're not logistically at the same point in life and we might never be. Thiiiis noob was always on my case about how I needed to be more assertive and secure in our relationship, but he didn't have the gall to do the same. He's an extreme people pleaser, and he's becoming a total beefcake who's been swept by the upgrade mentality. Patronizing jerk.\n\nI used to swear that we were made at the same time (close bdays). And If I could go back, I would teach little me all that I needed to know in order to be ready for him to come along- after talking with some of my favorite revolutionaries, because this is all fantasy anyway. \n\nNow, I know it's not entirely my fault that I didn't wake up to some realities until it was too late to make a 180, but it still sucks knowing that I was left because of some bogus preconceived ideas.

I've posted on here a lot and gotten a lot of great advice.  Both of my puppies are really good dogs, and are pretty trainable.\n\nMy current problem is with Henry and his barking.  It's not that he barks too much or too often.  It *seems* like he barks a lot because Tillie hardly ever barks, but I'd guess he's pretty normal.  The problem is that when he *does* bark it's like ice picks through my fucking ear drums.  His bark is so high pitched and grating that it's intolerable.  Everyone hates it including Tillie who will often snap at him to get him to shut up (*thank you, Tillie!*)  Henry is such a good, cute dog, but the family, and anyone else who can hear him, hates the sound of his voice and it's making people not want to have him around.\n\nI've tried anticipating when he's going to bark, but he's a puppy and there's just no way to accurately predict when he might get it into his puppy brain to start barking.  I'm not suggesting that he should completely stop barking, that's his means of communication and he's actually (mostly) using it appropriately.  But is there any way to train him to ... I dunno, bark a little manlier?  There's not, is there?  :-\/","chosen":"Puppy's bark has the same timbre as 10,000 preteens at a One Direction concert.

Best I can think of is to ask a professor how to do that."}
{"prompt":"[This] thread got me thinking about the \"disgusting\" things I'd eat if I was *really* hungry. I don't mean the kind of hungry when lunch is still two hours away and the coffee you had for breakfast isn't helping anymore and you groan to your coworker *\"I'm starving!\"* I mean hungry like you haven't had a bite to eat in days and you're not sure when you'll eat again.\n\nFor me, it was 1994 and I was 20 years old living with my first boyfriend. We often survived on end-of-day leftovers at our crappy fast food jobs. Business got slow and we both got fired from our jobs and we were just too dumb to think about the fact that the money we were spending on cigarettes and Dr. Pepper should *probably* be used for PB&J. \n\nHe got a part time job at KFC so he got at least one free meal a day, and I'd usually walk there to share that with him. It was almost Thanksgiving and his hours got cut back from 24 a week to 18, then 12, then they let him go altogether. Just before he left, he stole a bag of powdered mashed potatoes. (Desperate times, desperate measures?) We ate mashed potatoes for every meal for a week until it was just gone. Then there was nothing, and it was the day after Thanksgiving and all the food pantries were closed, and then it was the weekend and we were SO hungry.\n\nThose three days with nothing but water were probably the longest of my life. Strangely, after the 24 hour mark I stopped feeling hunger pains and just felt tired and moody. Any time I thought about food, I'd drink water or eat ice.

His family hated me, they felt I stole away their little boy, and there's no way they'd have fed me. My family wasn't talking to me because I was \"living in sin\" with him, so I didn't have backup like he did.)","chosen":"Boyfriend and I went hungry for three days, stealing food from KFC, not caring about consequences, just desperate to eat.

He's a terrier mix, looks like a tall Yorkshire Terrier.

I ramped up his exercise since he's reached a healthy weight, but I don't seem to be hitting a ceiling. He gets three walks a day, his morning and afternoon walks are almost always over 40min and can be over an hour (if they're any shorter, he'll get a 4th walk in the day). Most of the time I go out on the bike and depending where we are he's attached to my waist or running free, in which case he covers way more ground. His third walk is just a bedtime wee and is generally less the 20min and never with the bike.

I don't really want to press her further if she's unwilling to talk, but on the other hand I need a better understanding of what's going on right now.. if someone can help me decipher the cryptic messages she sent, it would be much appreciated.\n\nWe've been apart for nearing two months now but I have a flight to visit her in a little under two weeks.","chosen":"long distance for two months, visiting her soon, but she suddenly stopped communicating over the weekend and now says she has something she wants to talk about but won't talk about it right now","rejected":"GF (interning abroad) sent me suspiciously long messages about something she wants to talk to me about but won't talk about right now."}

{"prompt":"About a year ago, this guy asked my friend's sister to prom. He was interested in her, and she basically had no interest in him. She said yes, but only as friends. Even after this he clearly still had feelings for her. She didn't really have any interest in dating him, but she thought maybe she'd try going on a couple dates with him. She wasn't sure if she genuinely wasn't interested or she was just scared because she hadn't really had any relationship experience before. \n\nI know this guy because we have a class together and we sit together. He's somewhat shy, but sweet and funny. We've spent some time together, we co-led a group of kids at a volunteer event, and obviously I'm around him every day. I definitely have at least some feelings for him, and I can't really tell if he reciprocates, he's just generally a very quiet person.\n\nHim and my friend's sister went on a few dates, and as it turned out it was somewhat awkward and very very platonic. Neither of them attempted to make any move on the other, and things were generally very tense. Like, sitting down and having a pro-cons conversation about kissing eachother and then not kissing eachother tense. She plans on breaking whatever this is off with him the next time she sees him, but she doesn't even know if this will be necessary because they haven't even hung out in a month. Any interest that either of them had is dead.\n\nAs I said earlier, I kind of like this guy. Graduation is soon and we'll soon be going our separate ways, though we'll still be in the same area.

{"prompt":"Earlier this year, I applied for a summer job at my university. It paid decently but allowed me to take classes offline, which I preferred to do, so I went for it. At the same time, a friend of mine (we'll call him Jack) was applying for the job.\n\nJack became a dick about the job really quickly. Told me I wasn't really qualified (even though I'd been working for the department this job came through for a year) and that my customer service skills were lacking (even though he's seen my boss praise them). Needless to say, I was unhappy and pride mode went into overdrive.\n\nOriginally, my plan was to go in and just talk about what I knew and how I could be of service. But his lack of faith made me step it up a notch. I talked to people who had the job in the past. I did research on the people hiring me. I even went to one of the old hirers to get some tips. I was running at 110%.\n\nInterviews end and we find out the results. I got the job. Jack didn't. I went to go talk to him about it but was pulled aside by my friend first, who showed me tweets Jack made saying I was cocky and didn't deserve the job. His reasoning was that I said I wish I knew if I got the job sooner than the date we were expected to, because I just wanted to know so I could get on with my life and stop stressing. He took it as me thinking I got the job.\n\nKnowing about the tweets (I don't use Twitter), I decided to be the lesser man in the situation. At this time, Jack and I were roommates. I walked it and he was quiet. Obviously pissed at me. So I go next door to our friend's room and just shouted \"[FRIEND] I GOT THE JOB! I'M SO EXCITED!\" The walls of our dorm were small.

She hasn't finished college, and probably won't now. Her boyfriend can't provide anything, because he works in fast food. But the biggest problem is that she just had *gastric bypass* and now we're concerned that she won't receive the medical attention\/nutrition she and the baby need.

{"prompt":"I had a book when I was a kid in the early or mid 80s ... about a cat that has a bad habit of eating shoelaces.  It tells a moral story about gluttony\/overindulgence and the cat gets bigger and bigger.  I think it also ate typewriters, or maybe just the keys.  The cat's parents are involved at some point.  The cat is reproved -- maybe by a doctor? -- who convinces the cat to eat such treats in moderation.  There might have also been turnips?? but I might be confusing the turnip part with a different book.  The book ends with the cat losing weight, and he only *occasionally* indulges in a typewriter key.   I remember the drawings -- a cat with shoelaces hanging all out of its mouth, and I think there were a variety of typewriters and different-looking keys.  To my recollection the drawings were black and white, pen-style.  Obviously this book left an impression on me.  I was hoping to give it to my nephew as a present, but I can't find it anywhere.  You would think the terms \"cat\", \"typewriter\", \"shoelaces\" aren't usually combined and would easily point to something.

{"prompt":"Two months ago my sister and her partner got two kittens for their kids. At the same time they called a pet insurance company, and since their economy is not the best, they asked to receive an automatic monthly payment plan.\n\nTo cut that story short, they screwed up and sent an invoice for the entire yearly fee, and forgot to send papers for the monthly plan.\n\nFast forward to last week. They got the kittens neutered at a vet, but one of them had some complications afterwards and they ended up having to perform surgery on it last night.\n\nBut before they went to have that done, they called the insurance company to make sure that everything was alright, and they confirmed that it indeed was.\nHowever, after the procedure was over, the company called and told them that the insurance was not in fact valid. It appears that here was still one day left of the 20 waiting days before it kicks in, which they apparently started counting **after** all their screw-ups.\n\nMy sister was completely devastated by this, as they had to pay the full $2100 medical bill. The only way they had any chance of paying it was to take a loan, which on top of everything had no option of paying back over more than a year, which meant their economy would still be in chaos.\n\nAll of this happened after they had just managed to pay off a ton of other loans and started to their economy sorted.\n\nAfter I came home from work today and heard all of this, I immediately called my sister and told her \"don't worry, I'll foot the entire medical bill\". After hearing this, she just broke down in tears. When she could speak again she started thanking me because of how much it means for them and their economy.\n\nI also said that they should immediately complain to the insurance company to try and get them to pay, since it was their screw-ups that mean the insurance was not valid. But now my sister won't have to worry about how they are going to survive each month while that is going on.","chosen":"sister had to pay $2100 medical bill caused by insurance company, saved money to pay it off, sister broke down when I told her. what good deed have you done lately?","rejected":"sister and her partner screwed up with pet insurance, caused financial ruin which was avoided due to me footing the entire medical bill, saved them from crippling financial troubles. what good deed have you done recently?"}
{"prompt":"Let me start at the beginning. My boyfriend and I adopted our cat Spike in January of this year from the shelter, he will be a year old in October. The shelter spayed him before we took him home and he had no problems when we took him home. He can be a little asshole at times, but thats all cats. We moved from Indiana to Texas this May to a home with 1 cat and her litter of 5 kittens. Roomies got rid of 4 kittens but had to foster another pregnant cat, whose kittens are currently up for adoption (other momma cat was about to get fixed but ended up preggers again, waiting for that litter currently). He started peeing on roommates daughter's bed in June but we figured it was him marking his territory. A few weeks later, he peed on the roommates bed. Again, we thought it was just him marking. Until he started doing it on our bed. Every day. Took him to the vet to check everything out and he has a UTI. Started him on antibiotics about a week ago. For a few days he was going back in the box (we uncovered it and clean it everyday). A couple days ago, he peed on the pillows so they got thrown in the washer. Then last night, right in front of me, he peed on the sheets. Depending on if he stops or not, he's scheduled for another UA on Tuesday. Money is a factor right now. Me and boyfriend were wondering if there was anything we could use to discourage him from peeing on the bed again. We were going to look into Feliaway but have read mixed reviews and dont want to spend money we dont have on something that may or may not work. Hes fine with the kittens, he loves playing with them. So anything that wont cost an arm and a leg would be greatly appreciated.

I love seeing how supportive you guys are and it restores my faith in people quite often.  I like reading both subreddits when I'm upset.\n\nMy girlfriend, lets call her Samantha, has a lot of issues with her home life.  Her mom is bipolar and quite frankly nuts, she has these episodes where she physicially abuses Samantha and her younger siblings that live with her.  She has gone as far as throwing razor blades and glass objects at her.  Samantha does everything she can to make her mom calm down, but sometimes this is just met with even more violence.  Her mother will hit the younger kids as well and Samantha does her best to protect them and stand up for them.  \n\nEven when she isn't going through an episode like this, Samantha's mother doesn't treat her well in any respect.  She gives her the responsibilities of an adult, yet treats her like a child.  Samantha has 2 facebook accounts, the initial reason being that her mother wouldn't let her talk to her dad and his side of the family, but now she uses it a lot to talk to my mom and I.  Her mother knows the account information for her original one and goes on there and reads her conversations and such.  She does everything she can to control every aspect of Samantha's life.  It seems like she's even trying to break us up, but I doubt that's going to work out for her.\n\nMy mom told her that we would all come up with something together to do to help her, but I honestly don't know what kind of a solution could be presented.

The two of us are the youngest members of our team by a significant margin. We happen to come from the same country, he's been here for about 3 years. There aren't many young single women in my industry, so for the first few months I was swamped with suitors, but Mark (as is proper for a coworker) never showed any sign of interest.\n\nAbout 6 months ago my team moved offices, and I had to start sharing an office with Mark. Naturally we started to casually chat more once we were crammed in the same 12 square yards for 9 hours a day, and I've slowly started to develop an irrational infatuation with him.

I have been dating a fair amount recently, exclusively through apps like Tinder, OKcupid, and Hinge (meeting people to date in person is quite difficult, as I'm sure many of you know). I dated one person for about a month, but then broke it off with her, as she made some really inappropriate comments to me that raised some red flags.\n\nOther than that, I have not been on any second dates, by my own choosing. In my experience, internet dating (when you're looking for something beyond hooking up) is incredibly inefficient and mentally taxing.

We work in the same building and live together, so I understand what he means. I've always made an effort to give him space, but he doesn't take advantage of it. I say I understand and would enjoy time away as well. He says he doesn't want to mess things up between us by being together constantly. I can understand that.\n\nHere's the problem. He still hasn't changed his facebook relationship status. Am I right for being concerned? Should I give him his space and freedom to not list his relationship status?

{"prompt":"Long time lurker, made an account to tell this and hopefully stop stressing so much. So I'm a junior in High school, and a clumsy one at that. Yesterday during marching drill before actual practice began, me and some friends were all sitting outside in the small parking lot we have for band and sports personnel. The lot had been empty up until a few minutes before \"the event\" happened. I never noticed a car had come in, and was talking with a friend. Keeping eye contact and walking backwards at a moderate pace as she followed. Last second she yells \"PintoBean, STOP!\" and I quickly stop, stumble over my foot and fall straight back... into a car. I somehow made a 2 1\/2ft wide 1ft tall 1\/2in thick dent in the back door of this car (I'm about 5' 10\" and 145lbs). I limp my way inside to get the owner of the car, and he seems fine with it and just wants me to cover insurance\/ damages if needed, perfect, no issues, just a small mishap. This was reported to the office as an incident and I'm called in the next morning (day I'm posting) and he's in there, they contact my parents, clear things up, and I give the car owner my parents info to talk about insurance and what to do, the school at this point was just a medium for us to work this out through. So later that day I'm called into the office for the school police officer along with the friend I was talking to. We walk in with the principle I talked with in the morning. We are seated, the officer explains everything, tells us to be calm and we can work this out, average stuff. About near the end of him clearing things up, he breaks part of the news (couldn't tell us everything without the presence of a parent\/ guardian) that the owners mom is choosing to go through Juvenile Services and charge me as a criminal instead of just working out insurance.

{"prompt":"I (f\/18) was dumped via text by him (m\/18) after a 2.5 year relationship because he was not done 'partying' and felt as if we had growing up to do. Commonly these are signs of the 'grass is greener on the other side' syndrome. We just recently graduated and plan to attend college this fall (him at a university, me at a small community college about 30 minutes away.) The relationship was honestly very smooth, we were in love, had many plans and aspirations together and our families adored one another. He showed no signs of disinterest until about a week ago, he started partying more, hanging out with more friends that he normally wouldn't.\n \n\nNow, I had no problem with this, I never asked to join in on his fun time with friends, always offered to be a safe drive home and only asked for simple information in return, when he couldn't produce that information that is when it upset me. He started being shady, putting friends\/getting drunk before me especially at times I really needed him and finally ended it 3 days ago. All these newly developed characteristics are highly unlike him, if he comes back and gets his priorities in check what shall I do? This pattern could stop and then continue in college, yet I know school is a number one priority for him.\n \n\nI understand when he said we needed to grow. We've been together most of our high school years. But I also know that was just a diversion from the whole \"I want to go out and party\" and there is nothing better than growing WITH someone and if two people can do that it is truly amazing.

{"prompt":"Edit: what a convoluted title. \n\nI am so frustrated. We received an email from our wedding coordinator informing us that it was time to choose an officiant from the service (All Seasons) that is on contract with our venue. We went to their website and selected an officiant that really jumped out at both of us and submitted their web form, formally requesting him. A week later we received an email from them saying, \"[Venue] has contacted us to say you are getting married there. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding, it's time to pick an officiant and confirm all of these details regarding the location, date, time, and overall vibe of your ceremony.\" I replied back saying I had already been in contact to request an officiant and I answered ALL of her questions, and said that we were still in the process of confirming our ceremony time and that I would let her know ASAP. The next day I emailed again to confirm ceremony time, and within ten minutes I received a reply from her saying, \"Thanks for confirming your ceremony time, can you answer everything else now?\" Uhm, I already did. So I replied back answering all of her questions again and reiterating our interest in this one specific officiant. Three days go by and I receive ANOTHER email from her saying, \"Great, now all that is left to do is confirm your ceremony time and we can check if the officiant you want is available.\" Arg! I just don't understand why they can't pay attention to the things that I've emailed them. Should I send back one email reconfirming all information start to finish? I think if I get another email asking me any of the same questions again I'm going to go nuclear. How hard is it?

{"prompt":"Good morning, everyone!  I have a question that I (probably) already know the answer to, but I'm at the end of my rope so I have to ask it.\n\nI have two puppies - Tillie is 10 months old and Henry is 3.5 months old.  I've posted on here a lot and gotten a lot of great advice.  Both of my puppies are really good dogs, and are pretty trainable.\n\nMy current problem is with Henry and his barking.  It's not that he barks too much or too often.  It *seems* like he barks a lot because Tillie hardly ever barks, but I'd guess he's pretty normal.  The problem is that when he *does* bark it's like ice picks through my fucking ear drums.  His bark is so high pitched and grating that it's intolerable.  Everyone hates it including Tillie who will often snap at him to get him to shut up (*thank you, Tillie!*)  Henry is such a good, cute dog, but the family, and anyone else who can hear him, hates the sound of his voice and it's making people not want to have him around.\n\nI've tried anticipating when he's going to bark, but he's a puppy and there's just no way to accurately predict when he might get it into his puppy brain to start barking.  I'm not suggesting that he should completely stop barking, that's his means of communication and he's actually (mostly) using it appropriately.  But is there any way to train him to ... I dunno, bark a little manlier?  There's not, is there?  :-\/","chosen":"3 month old puppy barks like nails on a chalkboard.  I'd like to train him to bark a little less.

I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nSo I get home from work and get down to business.  Ozzy's catching on pretty quickly.  Within 10 minutes, I have him rolling onto his back on command.  I was pointing my finger at him and saying, \"BANG!\" as a cue.  Suddenly though, as he's lying on his back, he pees a little.

He's obviously ashamed of himself, even though I didn't get mad at him as it was my fault.\n\nAfter we've cleaned up and gone out for a pee break, I attempt the trick again.

Since then, he gets stressed when you make a finger gun at him, or if you say the word bang.  He will often try to slink under the computer desk or go into his kennel.\n\nSo my theories on what might be going on:\n\n* He somehow associated the memory of wetting himself to the cues I gave him\n* He's afraid of fireworks and thunderstorms and the loud \"BANG\" is too harsh of a cue word\n* The word \"BANG\" sounds too close to the word \"Bad\" and he thinks that when I point at him and say it, that he's being punished for something.\n\nIn any case, it's been months and I can't even bait him to lie on his back anymore.

His ex was a big traditionalist and would always go on and on about her dream wedding with him. Showing him dresses, rings and venues that she wanted to get married at. This always upset him because he said he doesn't like traditional romance and she would berate him for it calling him a bad boyfriend and saying things like \"he must not really love her.\" Besides her, he also isn't religious and doesn't want us to mingle money because he feels it would cause more arguments partially due to us having very different spending styles. All of this is fine with me (I actually earn more than he does). But I am rambling a bit. Should I just show him the ring? Should I just say fuck it and buy it for myself and ask for something less \"controversial\" or should I ask him but preface it with \"I know it's says engagement but I am not suggesting you propose.\" \n\nSeems like a very small issue and it really isn't a big one. I just don't want to ask people I know IRL because I don't feel like getting the \"WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST GET MARRIED! Why SHOULDN'T he propose???\" etc.","chosen":"I saw a ring I want for Xmas that is an engagement ring but I want the ring just to have it and don't want him to think I am trying to get him to propose.","rejected":"I came across a cool engagement ring that I don't want to suggest to my boyfriend that I want him to propose.

However his behavior is very strange sometimes. We see each other every week (apart from this week) and he usually comes round, hangs out, and sometimes we have sex. He seems to really be into me but he claims to not want to make things official.\n\nThe confusing thing is all his actions prove otherwise, he casually dropped into convo that he was my boyfriend. And generally being intimate and affectionate when ever we're together. And the other week he mumbled \"why have you made me love you\" while we were drinking. But now he says I want more than what he does. I just don't get it because up until now, he's been more into me than I have been into him. He says he enjoys being with me, but doesn't want to be my boyfriend. He says he's still into me though, I just don't get it!\n\nCan someone help me decipher this?

{"prompt":"So my ex and I were in a long-short-distance relationship which was causing a lot of pressure on our relationship. We got very serious way too quick and that led to some arguments about trust (whether I can trust his promises about the future). This is his first relationship, which I think makes the whole thing even more stressful for him. He said that when he's with me, we feel like forever and that's why our relationship seems stressful because he's never been with anyone else before.

He lives 6 hours away and we've visited each other only three times, but we communicate frequently via text, phone, email, and (occasionally) written letters. When we first met I fell SO HARD for him. He was a 99% match on OKcupid and on paper he seemed like a perfect mate for me, so even though I had thought I was forever done with LDRs I figured I would give it a try. He has been nothing short of super sweet and patient with me always, which I have never experienced before, and he has surprised me numerous times with some truly beautiful and touching hand-made gifts.\n\nHowever, since our last visit I've had this feeling that we're just not right for each other in the long run. We have differing opinions about how quickly we want to move forward and whether or not to someday have kids, and there is a palpable lack of chemistry; dates with him involve SO. MUCH. AWKWARD. SILENCE. It is killing me that this wonderful guy just isn't right for me. I wish I could be as giving and loving to him as he has been to me, but it just feels weird and I know I have to break it off.\n\nThe problem is, we are supposed to go away for what was going to be a \"romantic weekend\"...

I already know I want to go out of state to the better college but I haven't broken this news to my girlfriend yet. She believes that I'll stay in state and stay with her through college. Now I love her a lot and I care about her a lot but I know I need to value my education more right now. However when we've talked about me going to college she's made it clear that if I decide to go to the far away college she rather just have us break up now so she won't get her self more attached\/in love with me. \n\nNow I've made my decision already but I'm not ready to lose her and I don't want to lose her when I still have almost a year before I leave. I know I need to tell her soon that I'm leaving and I don't want to drag this out and make this hurt her more but at the same time I know telling her will make her want to break up. My dream situation is to tell her now and get her to understand and want to stay with me for the year before I leave and have an amazing year with each other. I just don't know if that can happen. We love each other a lot both and she tells me that I'm the only guy who has ever made her this happy and stuff and we both deeply care about each other.

{"prompt":"I (26M) have been dating this girl (21F) for somewhere over a month now. I recently told her that we should be exclusive, but I am starting to regret that. There are a couple issues: first, the physical distance between us and, second, her disproportionate feelings toward me. \n\nHer parents live about 20 minutes away from me so the distance wasn't a big deal for our first couple of dates. However, she is an undergraduate in a college that is 2.5 hours away from the city that I live\/grad school that I attend. I've gone up and spent the weekend at her place, and she recently came down and split time with her family and me. \n\nThat's when we had a conversation, and we agreed to be exclusive. We agreed to take turns seeing each other every 2 weeks or so. We text and skype quite often to compensate for the lack of personal interaction. \n\nIt's obvious to me that she has intense feelings toward me, but I just don't feel such mad \"love.\" Example: I barely use facebook except for the chat function, but she just litters my wall with stuff. At the end of our recent meetup where she came to see me, she actually cried when it was time to say goodbye for 2 weeks. \n\nDon't get me wrong. We get along great.

Yesterday during marching drill before actual practice began, me and some friends were all sitting outside in the small parking lot we have for band and sports personnel. The lot had been empty up until a few minutes before \"the event\" happened. I never noticed a car had come in, and was talking with a friend.

{"prompt":"Hello. I would like to read a personal finance book that emphasizes long term planning, cost saving, and the idea of financial security over showing off status symbols.

I have always been very financially aware and frugal, but my wife hasn't. She comes from a family that never budgeted or planned anything (and has been through bankruptcy).

But I hadn't thought about the pictures, she was just using it to go online on though so I didn't think much of it. I came back in the room and got my phone back and we just went on with our evening.\n\nBut about an hour after she leaves I got some email notifications on my phone, that was weird because I don't have my email set up on my phone in the email app. So I check it and she had left her email signed in, I saw messages from herself to herself, of pictures that was sent around the time she wouldve been using my phone. I know it's kind of snooping but I clicked on it, and she literally sent pictures of my boyfriend on my phone, to her own email. So she probably has them saved on her computer or something now.\n\nI have no idea how to confront her about it because it's the most awkward situation ever, but I have to say something. And I want to make sure she deletes those pictures. I don't even want to continue our friendship anymore if she doesn't. I feel completely betrayed and I think that was disrespectful to my boyfriend, me, our relationship, and our friendship. I haven't told my boyfriend yet as I'm sure he'll be mad at me, but I'll tell him after I resolve this. What can I do?! :(","chosen":"My friend sent nudes of my boyfriend to her email and I don't know how to confront her about it and I don't want to continue our friendship.","rejected":"My friend sent nudes of my bf to her own email in the time that she used my phone to do so.

{"prompt":"This past Saturday, my wife and I went out on a bike ride with two of my friends. She had just ordered some new clip in pedals and wanted to try them out. However she never practiced clipping in and out of the pedals and she ended up falling several times. Her last big fall, she ended up having a big scrape on her butt. She's been asking me to help her treat it since apparently my wife isn't that coordinated with cleaning a wound while looking at a full body mirror.\n\nFast forward to today. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law ask to come over to get some headache medicine. My s.i.l. wasn't feeling well, so I said sure. I wasn't aware that my wife was in the shower at the time. Out of habit, they both visit quite often and I usually unlock the door for them to come in. \n\nWife comes out the shower and asks for my help once again to clean her wound on her butt. I'm still very hesitant to do it for her, but I give in. She comes in to the living room and lays on her stomach with neosporin and peroxide, ready for me to clean it. PRESUME THE CLEANING! Peroxide goes on and my wife does that \"SSSSSSS\" sound when something hurts, but you don't want to let out that sound. Still, it's loud enough for others to hear since she doesn't have a high tolerance for pain. Then I proceed to put the neosporin on her butt wound. As soon as I start, front door opens and brother and sister in law are coming in. First words they hear are \"Now doesn't that feel better?\" as I rub the neosporin,a bunch of thick white pain relief cream, on the wound. My wife jumps up out of embarrassment, and runs in the bedroom to isolation. My b.i.l and s.i.l just stare at me in all sorts of what the hell did I walk in on. To save the embarrassment and awkwardness of the situation, I just gave them the headache medicine and apologized profusely.","chosen":"I unlocked the front door for my brother in law and sister in law and they end up walking in on me putting a thick white pain relief cream on my wife's ass to clean a wound.","rejected":"TIFU by opening the front door to help my wife clean her butt wound, and the brother and sister in law came in."}

Turns out she has only had one long term boyfriend and then nothing until she went to Thailand. Whilst travelling, she admitted to sleeping with four guys on one night stands (including me). She said she slept with one guy after meeting me and whilst we were still talking a lot.\n\nFor some reason this really bummed me out and made me feel awkward. Over the last few weeks I kind of accepted it but recently its playing on my mind again. I don't like the fact that four out of her five sexual partners were one night stands, especially when done in such a short time scale on holiday. I don't know, I don't want to upset her but I just find it hard to think about and makes me feel as if she was 'easy' and would go back with any random bloke during the holiday. I understand that I can't think this way, but the whole thing just makes me feel upset. Also, the fact that she slept with someone after me makes me feel even worse. I just feel as if the way we met isn't special at all, in-fact it makes me feel a bit awkward thinking about the way we met.\n\nI don't really know how to handle my thoughts and emotions about the whole thing, because everything else in our relationship is fine and I don't want it to interfere.","chosen":"I found out my girlfriend had only had one real boyfriend before she went to Thailand.

I've known these two friends since pre-school and they happen to live in my same neighborhood so naturally we talk often and have all grown kind of close over the years. They are twins, so I've usually hung out with both of them together. However, they each have very different personalities and their traits have even grown more distinct throughout high school and I am beginning to absolutely despise one of the twins (I'll refer to her as A).\n\n A has, over the period of about a year, become extrememly moody, aggressive, and exhausting to talk to. Our personalities conflict and we bicker often. I am usually able to laugh it off; she holds grudges. She has started conflicts with me for absolutely no reason and it has progressed to the point where I no longer enjoy being around her and I automatically feel defensive whenever I see her, because of her offensive attitude. \n\nHowever, B & I (the other twin) are the best of friends. Our personalities compliment each other well, and the conflict between A & I has only served to strengthen our friendship. We get along well. I just don't see how I will be able to remain friends with her if I plan to cut A out of my life (even though they \"hate\" each other, they do everything together and have the same mutual friends). It is incredibly frustrasting and I feel I am causing even more conflict between the two of them. For example, A & B give me rides to school (they share a car) sometimes work as well, but after an argument, A told me she would no longer provide transportion for me.

I want to be able to take off my shirt at the beach, I want to be able to play soccer without flying away and all the other activities.\n\nTired of the skinny guy problems I decided to change by hitting the GYM and eating more. But now that change is finally starting to come to realization, my parents are slowly discouraging me to continue and are advising me to stop. I went from 58.5KG to 64.6KG in a few months, and I'm very proud of my result. But my parents believe that my weight should stay at 64.6KG, and not increase to around 75KG (my goal).\n\nThey believe that my knees and ankles won't be able to hold it out, and when I get old I won't be able to walk properly anymore. Another believe is that ''Lifting is damaging your body because you're an ectomorph'', which frustates me... because there are plenty of other ectomorphs out there and are doing fine, right? Another reasoning they told me is that, even though I work hard now it wont matter because when I turn older I wont have control of my body and I will suddenly get fat or skinny and thus making exercising now useless.\n\nAre my parents right, is excising really damaging my body and will I regret doing it in the future? Or are they still used to seeing the skinny skeleton me, and they don't like change, which is what I tend to believe more but I'm doubting myself.","chosen":"Parents say I'm damaging my body, my body doesn't fit fitness\/working out.

{"prompt":"Super quick background: we got together spring of our senior year of undergrad, knowing full well we weren't sure where either of us would end up after graduation.

Almost a year later, we decided to get back together despite the hardship of distance.\n\nIt's going fantastically. But I'm feeling a lot of guilt about how unequal our relationship is due to finances. Being in grad school, I have barely enough income for basic needs. He's making very decent money at his full time job. When we first got together, it was important to me to split costs evenly, alternating who pays for dates, going Dutch, etc. But now he pays for most things and I feel so guilty. (Spoiled and well taken care of, too! but not comfortably.) Most recently, he flew out to see me, and when we discussed the next time we'd see each other, he immediately bought tickets to fly me out to his city. It makes me feel like I owe him. I think it's important to note that these feelings are only on my end. He does this completely willingly, and he does not mind at all paying for things. He considers it an investment in our time spent together, and not just for my benefit.\n\nI'm looking for advice on how I can deal with feeling inadequate until I graduate (one more year!) and can contribute financially to our relationship.

{"prompt":"Hey Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me out with this one.  \nSo, here's the story so far: I'm friends with a girl (she is a good friend of my girlfriend) who, from my point of view, is a bit in a rough spot right now. She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).\n  \nSo, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  \nThere is just one problem though: no fucking.  \n\nYou might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird. My friend has tried her best to initiate any kind of affectionate interaction. The closest was her grabbing his dick. He just laughed in return, said that he is a little bit tired and then they proceeded to hug each other and fall asleep (oh yeah they did make out once but did not proceed to sexual intercourse, since this bloke used the same excuse to \"get out of it\")  \nSo, despite them seeing each other every day, despite clear initiatives coming from her side, nothing has happened yet. Weirder yet, my friend has totally fallen for this guy. The bloke doesn't seem to show clear signs of affection. But why would he then continue to see her every other day? Am I just over-analyzing stuff? Its weird, it seems to me that this guy is actually afraid of sex or something of that sort...","chosen":"My friend is in a relationship with a guy who doesn't seem to want to have sex with her.

{"prompt":"We're both 19, and we've known each other for nearly 7 years at this point.  We both did well in high school, I'm doing fine in college, but he isn't.  He started as an engineer, then realized that that wasn't for him after nearly failing out of college #1 in two semesters.  \n\nOver the summer, he went to summer school and got accepted into a program at a local university (college #2) where he would become a full-time student after attending as a non-matriculated student for the fall semester.  I thought that everything was going to be all right with him; he seemed to do well, and from what I heard he was doing well at the beginning of the fall.\n\nHowever, I found out yesterday that he had decided to drop out and try his luck in a full-time job.  His reasoning behind this is that because he's failing 2 of his 4 classes; he tried an outside tutor who was a complete waste of time, and apparently there's a law that says a non-matriculated student cannot use the university's tutoring resources.  \n\nI can't find this law anywhere online, but even if it does actually exist, one of the classes he's failing is one whose equivalent here I happened to get an A in and I would be perfectly willing to tutor him.  I've tried talking to him and he just won't listen to reason.  He just wants to move in with his girlfriend when she moves close to him to go to school and become an apprentice sword-smith.  Sadly, yes, you read that last line correctly.\n\nThe county he lives in has one of the highest unemployment rates in the state overall, never mind for someone without a college degree; I get the sense he is throwing his life away and I desperately want to help him.  First, is it even possible to get the college to take him back?  From what I've heard, he only dropped out at the end of last week.  Second, how can I convince him to go back- and that I'm willing and able to help him with the classes he's having trouble with?","chosen":"My best friend is dropping out of college and wants to move in with his girlfriend to become an apprentice sword-smith.

{"prompt":"Hey,  r\/relationships! Looks like I'm beginning to be a regular poster here if you include my primary account. Not the best feeling though, haha. Anyways. \n\nI met him (27 M) during the time that I was on the rocks with another relationship (LDR,  if that matters). During that time I never hit on him even though I felt attracted to him because of my relationship. When that relationship ended, he was one of the people who helped me get back on my feet and even went with me on a holiday because the ex (25 M) and I planned it out before breaking up. So as I tried to get over my ex, I had sex with the guy because based from his stories, he told me that he's been single for more than a year and I was beginning to trust him more. \n\nThat was a month ago, and just recently, have hooked up again, twice. The red flag I should have noticed is he refuses to be Facebook friends or even let me follow his Twitter as he's following mine. The only thing I follow him on is Instagram, which is how I learned that he has a girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend (27\/28 F) knew about me THE ENTIRE TIME and decided to post about me on her blog, telling that I chose to play a losing battle. The thing is, I never knew. He's only told me of having a girl best friend but never the degree. \n\nI'm more hurt about this betrayal than the relationship I had that I just recently moved on from because I really thought that this guy would be honest and a special person in my life. I told my closest friends what to do and they told me to stick to a decision I can live through. \n\nSo this is why I'm here, yet again. I still want him to be a part of my life and he's told me he'd still stick around (I know, words are nothing) but I think that if only I didn't have sex with him then I would forgive him easily.","chosen":"Had sex with a friend who turns out has a girlfriend.

{"prompt":"Throw away account here. Im going to make as short as I can because I am too broken up to even sit at my computer right now, Its been a real rough night. So last night me and and my gf of 3 years who I live with decided to do our own thing. I was supposed to crash at a close friend of mines place for the night but decided against it last minute. I had tried texting and calling my gf during the course of the night to no avail. I wasn't very happy about this but just figured she was drunk with her girlfriends and that I would just catch her at the house. Well when I got home I walked up to my front door to see my girlfriend walking in the house with some dude I have never seen before. He splits when he sees me and me and my girlfriend fight all night over it. She can barely stand up or talk because she is so wasted and eventually passes out. So, I don't know what to do. Should I take her back? How do I handle this? We have been living together for 2 years and together for 3. Most of my life revolves around the relationship and Ive honestly always thought that I couldn't find a girl who would do as much as she does for me. She makes more money and pays most of the bills and yet doesn't look down on me for it. She has always been extremely supportive of me though everything and I feel like she loves me for me. I have severe anxiety and she has been there to hold my hand in the hospital through many panic attacks. Im closer to her than any person on the planet. This morning she woke up and is destroyed by what happened and is begging me to take her back. She says she was getting a ride home and was going to pass out but who knows.

{"prompt":"Long time lurker, made an account to tell this and hopefully stop stressing so much. So I'm a junior in High school, and a clumsy one at that. Yesterday during marching drill before actual practice began, me and some friends were all sitting outside in the small parking lot we have for band and sports personnel. The lot had been empty up until a few minutes before \"the event\" happened. I never noticed a car had come in, and was talking with a friend. Keeping eye contact and walking backwards at a moderate pace as she followed. Last second she yells \"PintoBean, STOP!\" and I quickly stop, stumble over my foot and fall straight back... into a car. I somehow made a 2 1\/2ft wide 1ft tall 1\/2in thick dent in the back door of this car (I'm about 5' 10\" and 145lbs). I limp my way inside to get the owner of the car, and he seems fine with it and just wants me to cover insurance\/ damages if needed, perfect, no issues, just a small mishap. This was reported to the office as an incident and I'm called in the next morning (day I'm posting) and he's in there, they contact my parents, clear things up, and I give the car owner my parents info to talk about insurance and what to do, the school at this point was just a medium for us to work this out through. So later that day I'm called into the office for the school police officer along with the friend I was talking to. We walk in with the principle I talked with in the morning. We are seated, the officer explains everything, tells us to be calm and we can work this out, average stuff. About near the end of him clearing things up, he breaks part of the news (couldn't tell us everything without the presence of a parent\/ guardian) that the owners mom is choosing to go through Juvenile Services and charge me as a criminal instead of just working out insurance.

{"prompt":"My friend and I decided that we wanted to get married... however, this isn't a typical marriage.\n\nBeing that I'm gay and want kids and she, after having a rough childhood, is wanting stability, we came to realize that we could help each other out. What we're looking at doing is entering a temporary, 5 year marriage in our home state of Wisconsin where the conditions would be that we have a few children (she is wanting them too) and I'd help her get through college. Being that I'm graduating this spring, I'd be bringing in most of the income at first and I'm alright with that.\n\nAnyways, we'd be signing a prenuptial contract that would declare that the marriage would only last five years. Now as to whether or not this is legal- I do not know. However, the deal would be that after 5 years, we would have the option to go our own way so long as we were equally involved with the kids. We would keep our finances separate except for those finances related to housing and raising the kids and the marriage would be open.\n\nSo with all of this in mind, is there anyway for us to mentally prepare ourselves for this? Is this a good idea or a bad idea and what steps should we take in doing this? Finally, how would we explain this to our families and later on to our kids? And most importantly, could we end up scarring them for life doing this or would they likely be understanding?","chosen":"Friend and I decided we wanted to get married- not a typical marriage.

{"prompt":"For the last 2 years I have been working with this girl. In that time we have had a lot of time to chat to one another and for the past year I have really wanted to ask her out on a date. The trouble is that she is 17 years old  (18 shortly after new year) and I'm concerned that the age gap is too large considering how young she is. A 23 year old dating a 17 year old seems a bit predatory to me.\n\nWhen it comes to dating, I have almost no experience and she could be the first person that I ask out.

{"prompt":"Okay so I didn't really get both my front teeth but I couldn't pass up the title and as most TIFU post begin, mine too starts with a little backstory. I'll try to be quick.\n\nSo in the 6th grade I was on my way to school on my bike just as I would do any other day. Suddenly, and I shit you not, some jackass I had never met decided to kick me off of my bike. I wasn't expecting this and so when he kicked the peg of my bike I swerved too hard and as my front tire went perpendicular I flew off the bike, and onto the pavement, teeth first. Luckily my teeth only had some cracks in them and they really weren't noticeable. My lip on the other hand was split wide open but that part isn't important to the post.\n\nSo here I am about a week ago at my friends house having a few beers and taking shots while playing a Mario kart drinking game when some more people show up so we're gonna go to Gamestop to get more controllers. (Sober driver drove, obviously) While walking out of his room my friend looks up and blows on the plastic piece of those pull strings that you use to let down the foldable attic stairs, you know what I mean. (I added a photo of the one in my house but it doesn't have the plastic piece) In any case it shoots up the string and makes it quite high and so I, in my infinite tipsy wisdom decided to beat his \"record\". Now I'm shorter than my friend by a few inches and I know there's no way I'll beat his \"record\" if my breath dissipates before it reaches the plastic handle thing. Naturally this prompts me to jump a bit off the ground so as to compensate for the height difference. I hop, I push with my breath, I only get the plastic piece a few inches up the string. This is followed by me closing my mouth on the way down from the hop and the plastic piece hooking on the back of my tooth and shattering it. The next day I went to the dentist and had my tooth bonded. My mother said it was a Christmas gift.","chosen":"Had shitty attempt at beating friend's record for getting teeth; failed miserably by misjudging height difference between foot and tooth; then had tooth bonded over christmas.","rejected":"TIFU by getting tipsy, \"competing\" with my friend, shattering part of my tooth, and getting it for Christmas."}
{"prompt":"So, my best friend, who I've had a crush on for about 2 years, has started getting really flirty with me. There are a couple of reasons why this is weird to me.\n\nFirst, we've been friends for about 3 years, and has never seemed interested in me. When I first told her about my crush on her, she got really distant, and it took a while just to be comfortable around her again, but now our relationship is as strong as ever.\n\nSecond, she's really involved with another guy, who I personally think is below her standards. However, I try and stay out of the relationship as much as possible and just let them do their thing. However, she has gotten more and more flirty with me as she has been dating this guy.\n\nShe is very, very uncomfortable with touching other people, but recently (as in last weekend), began to put her arm on my shoulder, tickle me, hit me playfully, and is allowing me to do the same. This morning in class, i was tickling her, and she was perfectly fine. Then another of her friends put their hand on her shoulder to ask her a question, and she freaked out.\n\nI've also noticed that she has started talking really quietly around me, forcing me to move my head in closer so I can hear her. When I do this, she flits her eyes between my eyes and my lips. I've also caught her looking at me from across the room quiet often, and even though we are good friends, she looks away as if she's really shy or embarrassed.\n\nI think she may be developing a crush on me, but maybe I'm just becoming really close with her, and she is just becoming more comfortable with me. Any thoughts? Also, if it becomes obvious that she does indeed have feelings for me, is it appropriate to make a move while she is with this other guy (their relationship is about 7 months now)?","chosen":"My best friend, whom I've had a crush on for over 2 years, has started acting very flirty with me, but she is still in a relationship.

{"prompt":"Short version.  I'm 46 years old with emphasis on OLD.  Many miles on the engine.  Bad joints, bad hip, fat, and at best average looks.  I have a stable job but I've been single since my last relationship ended in 1995.  \n\nFor reasons that are not clear to me I seem to have attracted the attention of a far younger, fitter, better looking etc. woman who has a stable career of her own and zero reason to be interested in me romantically.  But given how isolated I've been for the past two decades, it may be she just sees me as a friend and this is all in my head.  So I need to figure out what the heck is going on here.  If it's just friendship, I can rest easy.  Otherwise it's off to Belize on a fake passport. Facts:\n\n--She has asked me over to her place maybe half a dozen times, but has never been romantic with me.\n--More recently while sitting in my truck cab she leaned in for what I swear was a kiss, which I dodged and turned into a cheek hug.\n--She's since asked me out to lunch and requested I ask her next time (not sure what that's about)\n--She pm's me on facebook several times a day and has talked about very personal things with me.\n--Most recently we did a drive out to an event and she hugged after and later PM'ed me saying she had a fantastic time and loved hanging out with me.  \n\nSo what is this?  Is this just how younger people are now?  How will I know if something more is happening here?  She is WAY too good for the likes of me.  And I'm way too old.

We kept talking and she annoyed me a few times, a combination of me having a couple of bad days and her being a bit stand offish.

She messaged back very contritely and said she was always there for me.\n\nYet it doesn't seem like she is, she rarely starts conversations with me, about twice in the last 3 months and I just don't think she actually cares for me despite everything she says.

They don't look for work and those who do have jobs only do the bare minimum and have turned down shifts. It has caused a lot of issues in my parents's marriage, and I've known from a young age that I do not want that in my future.\n\nAm I a bad person for not wanting him to fund his family?

{"prompt":"(bit of a rant ahead) \n\nMy family is *extremely* unhealthy. Both of my parents are obese and my brother is one of those very picky eaters whose diet mainly consists of fast food, frozen junk, and just generally unhealthy meals\/snacks. I've been trying for years to get my family to have a more healthy diet, but the most I've managed is getting them to finally buy some frozen vegetables (and I'm the only one who eats them). Needless to say, there isn't a lot of healthy food in my house.\n\nI've managed to avoid becoming extremely unhealthy, but I've always been \"chubby\". I don't know what to do. For a while I said \"fuck it\" and started buying a lot of my own food, but it took up too much room in the kitchen so I had to stop. I still cook almost all of my own meals.\n\nThe thing that frustrates me most is that I know first-hand how much easier it is to stay healthy when I'm not surrounded by junk food. When I studied abroad, living in a family who barely had junk on hand, things like chips and pizza were a *treat* like they're supposed to be. Unhealthy foods rarely crossed my mind.\n\nI know there's not really much else to it besides sucking it up and controlling myself, but any kind words or \"tips\" would be helpful. I've recently gained a fair amount of weight and feel like I have to take this very seriously before I start heading down the road of my parents. I have zero real support from anyone around me, so it's difficult.","chosen":"I'm surrounded by unhealthy food and I'm trying to stay healthy, but I don't know how to do it.","rejected":"My house is filled with junk and I have no control over it.

Several times he has confessed to talking to women online, but usually not longer than a week and has no intentions of meeting them in real life.

He has almost no friends in reality (and has lost contact with most of the ones he had) and spends a lot of time playing online and console games. It took him half a year to make friends with the people he works with, and he still hasn't socialized with them outside of work.\n\nOh, and the ladies he chats with are not necessarily the most attractive women. They are average to even plain-looking. Part of me thinks he chooses these women because he knows he stands a better chance of them replying to his messages.\n\nWe have discussed most of this before.

I get a lot out of making him breakfast in the morning and leaving it on his nighttable while he sleeps, or tidying up his room while he's out.

We always argue about sex, and we always argue about going on dates, but it's not like we argue because he doesn't like the food I've cooked.  Being a mom in this case is stress-free, while in the other cases feelings and emotions are always in play.  I just don't know if I'm going to cope well with going back to how our relationship used to be.\n\nI'd like to talk about this with him, and I have tried to several times, but the conversation never really ends up being fruitful, so I'd like some advice from you more experienced individuals.","chosen":"I prefer being a 'mom' to my boyfriend rather than a girlfriend.

{"prompt":"Here's the sitch. \n\nI'm a 19y\/o guy, freshman in college, and I want to go on a date with this girl in my class. I have a crush on her, and she seems like a pretty cool person. \n\n**Thing is, I'm a bit cautious of asking this girl out;** **the idea of going out with her excites me too much!** I'm three months out from my first (three month long) relationship, and when I think about asking this girl out, I feel excited. I remember how fantastically awesome my first relationship was, and potentially having those awesome feelings again would be *wonderful*.\n\n**Do I have an unhealthy number of expectations?** I'm worried that I do! I've seen enough of this girl's personality every class to end up liking her, but I've barely interacted with her at all! I'm getting excited over something that doesn't even exist yet! \n\n**Also, I'm pretty certain that I've moved on from my old relationship.** I'm comfortable with who I am. I'm comfortable with being alone. It took a while, but I've finally started genuinely enjoying the single life. I've met new friends, and done new things. I'm enjoying myself! \n\nThis doesn't mean that I've completely forgotten about my last relationship. I remember the feelings I felt everyday. That being said, I mostly just miss being able to make someone I have feelings for happy, and cuddling with someone I have feelings for. It would be great to be able to do those things again, but they aren't something that I need to be happy. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Is it healthy for me to go into a relationship right now?

But...   \n**3.** She told me we can't meet face to face. I really want to meet her before she leaves. She said it's hard to do so here + her parents might not like that. I didn't want to insist, even though I had ideas on how to meet up in secret. I still really want to see her.\n\nSorry if there isn't enough info, I kinda rushed through this.

She told me how at the parties she went to that two guys kissed her. The first one she pushed away, but the second one I asked her if she kissed him back and she said yes and that she did it because it made her feel wanted, which I guess I haven't been making her feel that way lately. We cried, we talked about everything, we had great sex, and I stayed over at her house just to sleep with her and then snuck out in the morning so her parents wouldn't know.\n\nWe both obviously want to work things out but aren't sure if we should.

He felt really bad about it, so he thought he'd take her for a walk because Kent had talked about taking the dog for a walk soon.

People have mentioned it to him, he doesn't say anything. During a conversation with a group about partners and sex, he said to me that \"he might be a tiger in bed\". He's being sweeter, nicer and a little bit...cheeky.\n\nI am getting sick of lying and denying my feelings for him, I just want to tell him, but I'm scared that it will all go bad again.

{"prompt":"In June I met a guy on OkCupid. We're 10 hours apart but we seemed to hit it off so we kept texting. Since then he's drove up here once for a 4 day weekend and we met half way another weekend. Both times things just feel comfortable, like we've known each other for a long time. \n\nA couple weeks ago I mentioned I was going to a party and he jokingly mentioned me not sleeping with other guys. I was taken aback since we'd never talked about being exclusive and I asked him about it. We talked for about four hours about a bad experience with his high school sweetheart (she cheated a couple times and dragged him along for a while). I told him I wouldn't sleep with anyone else if he didn't want me to. He said over and over again how he didn't want to make me do something, but I told him I cared about his opinion. He said he wasn't used to someone saying that (he's only had a couple short lived relationships since his hs ex). Over all the conversation ended great and he's been a lot sweeter to me.\n\nSo I'm going to see him for another long weekend at the end of September I think I want to ask him to make it official. We're already exclusive so I don't really see a reason not to. But if he chooses not to be official I feel it would be a good time to end the relationship. I really enjoy seeing him and talking to him, but I'm not sure I want to commit to him if he's not ready to commit to me. But I get that I'm young and can be a little over emotional, so I just want your guys' opinion on this.","chosen":"Met guy on okcupid, really enjoy seeing him and talking to him, want to ask him to make it official but not sure if he's ready to commit.

{"prompt":"Less than a year ago, I (27\/F) met someone who has quickly become one of my best friends.  He (19\/M, who I will refer to as \"Friend A\") and I met online through a common interest.  As such, I have been able to join a wonderful community that I love spending time with.\n\nFriend A is close to another member of the group.  This friend (Friend B, who I am not particularly close to and don't know very well) suffers severe bouts of depression.  I'm not sure if they are seeking professional help for it, but Friend A suffers the same thing and I know for a fact that he IS receiving help every week.\n\nFriend B has a tendency to lash out when people aren't paying attention to them.  To the point of apologizing and saying things like \"I'm going away forever now, goodbye.\"  I've witnessed this on several occasions and frankly, it scares me, though I know there's nothing I can really do for them, I don't even know their name.  Friend A is substantially closer to Friend B, and recognizes a lot of their behavior from things in his own, fairly recent past (shortly before we met).\n\nAs a result, Friend B will directly contact Friend A and INDIRECTLY blame him for their depression, saying things like \"I really need this, why can't you do this for me?\" and expecting him to step up at least several times a day.  This is very emotionally draining for Friend A.\n\nHaving been in manipulative friendships myself, I'm seeing this behavior from Friend B, and all I can see is them trying to control Friend A in some way and I am NOT a fan.  Thing is, I don't know what I can do to help Friend A.  I really don't think they should be friends, and I especially hate seeing Friend A go through emotional turmoil for simply not responding to a post once in a while.\n\nI don't know how to approach my friend without coming off sounding manipulative myself.  I am genuinely concerned for Friend A because he means a lot to me, but at the same time, I understand where he's coming from and know just how touchy the whole situation can be.","chosen":"I have a friend who is being manipulated by another friend and I don't know how to help without sounding like a manipulative asshole.","rejected":"a friend has been manipulated by another friend in what seems like a way to hurt more uncomfortable and upsetting things for him. copy-pasted from Reddit"}
{"prompt":"So I have been dating my girlfriend for 6 years (high school sweethearts) and she is one of the nicest people I have ever met. I have always been extremely happy with our relationship because I feel that we are extremely compatible and there hasn't really anything wrong with our relationship. We only fight like once a year and have never broken up before.\n\nI am a personal trainer and recently I gave a fitness assessment and training session to this other girl who is incredible and I feel that we have an amazing amount of chemistry. I'm not sure if I have ever met someone who I've enjoyed talking to this much and I feel guilty that I can't really get her off my mind.\n\nI am a good guy who is just a little confused with how I'm feeling. This is kind of the first crush I've had since I've been with my girlfriend and I don't know what to make of it. I just want to be clear that I would never cheat on anyone and am not contemplating that in the slightest.\n\nWhile my relationship hasn't really ever been rocky, there are some underlying issues. One of the big ones is that we currently live in a big city that I am perfectly content with, but she hates it. We've been contemplating moving to a smaller town somewhere in a different state, but I am not sure if that is something I want. She really doesn't want to stay here and no matter which of us makes the compromise, I feel that the other will regret it.\n\nAbout 8 months ago, I also moved in to her apartment with her and her 2 female roommates, and this led me to feeling a little on & off depressed over the last 6 months. I originally thought that my sadness was just because I didn't really feel at home living with 3 girls and am used to \"me\" time as well as \"bro\" time with my former roommates. \n\nAll of these things combined with this crush that I now have are just leaving me confused and worried about the future.","chosen":"I am in a happy relationship but have recently developed a huge crush on another girl.

{"prompt":"Long time lurker, made an account to tell this and hopefully stop stressing so much. So I'm a junior in High school, and a clumsy one at that. Yesterday during marching drill before actual practice began, me and some friends were all sitting outside in the small parking lot we have for band and sports personnel. The lot had been empty up until a few minutes before \"the event\" happened. I never noticed a car had come in, and was talking with a friend. Keeping eye contact and walking backwards at a moderate pace as she followed. Last second she yells \"PintoBean, STOP!\" and I quickly stop, stumble over my foot and fall straight back... into a car. I somehow made a 2 1\/2ft wide 1ft tall 1\/2in thick dent in the back door of this car (I'm about 5' 10\" and 145lbs). I limp my way inside to get the owner of the car, and he seems fine with it and just wants me to cover insurance\/ damages if needed, perfect, no issues, just a small mishap. This was reported to the office as an incident and I'm called in the next morning (day I'm posting) and he's in there, they contact my parents, clear things up, and I give the car owner my parents info to talk about insurance and what to do, the school at this point was just a medium for us to work this out through. So later that day I'm called into the office for the school police officer along with the friend I was talking to. We walk in with the principle I talked with in the morning. We are seated, the officer explains everything, tells us to be calm and we can work this out, average stuff. About near the end of him clearing things up, he breaks part of the news (couldn't tell us everything without the presence of a parent\/ guardian) that the owners mom is choosing to go through Juvenile Services and charge me as a criminal instead of just working out insurance.

{"prompt":"My last relationship lasted 10 months and I gave it my everything. It seemed like a perfect match until one day he gave me the \"it's not you, it's me\" (which albeit was valid, as he does suffer from severe depression). It took me a while, but I recovered. That was about 4 months ago. \n\nFlash forward to now. After that didn't work out, I started going on casual dates and meeting new people. I actually found I really enjoyed it. It gave me space to focus on schoolwork (I'm an engineering major and have 3 jobs on campus so I'm pretty busy) and an openness in my social life. A few weeks ago, I met this guy at a party, and we started flirting, nothing crazy, kissed, then I left. I thought it was a one-off thing, but we ended up going on a few dates before break and talk a lot now. \n\nHe's made it very clear that he wants a relationship. He doesn't play mind games (my ex did and I hated it) and is genuinely very sweet and we're surprisingly compatible. Honestly, I could see it working out really well. The issue is that I have found that I really enjoy the single life. After giving so much to a relationship and watching it flounder, I realized that I can be all that I need, and while this new guy is wonderful, I don't really want the commitment attached to a 'relationship'.

Another reason I am upset is that last week we went out with some friends and he told everyone that he was leaving in the summer for a month to do an internship across the country. I had to leave and started crying when I got home. I was upset because he didn't even think about telling me this privately first and also because he's leaving before me and doesn't seem to mind. He is still adamant that he will love me no matter how far apart we are... but I'm not quite as secure. Of course, I want to be supportive, but I think it will take time.

The distance was rough on us, and it led to a lot of changes on my end. In the end, we decided to end it and did so amicably. When we first broke up, I asked that we remain friends and still update one another one each other's lives.
