{"prompt":"Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 7 months now, and it has been a blast since the very first day.

As far as I can tell, her main concern is that I have been intimate in the same ways with them as I have been with her.

I tend to be a little \"overly-attached\" at times, so I can't really object to this statement. It is not entirely impossible that I care for her the way I do simply because it's in my nature.\n\nHowever, I am positive that I have never been in love with anyone as I have been with my current girlfriend, and wouldn't want it all to end because of this.

{"prompt":"So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2\/28\/2011.","chosen":"Just bought a Garmin Forerunner 305 for a decent price.

{"prompt":"I'm going to start by saying I've (25f) been out of the dating game for about 3 years.

I met a man (26m) online a few weeks ago and we have just started seeing each other face to face. He is everything he seemed to be.

He has already said he's in no rush and is not pressuring me at all. In fact, we both have been very artful and skilled in letting up during our kissing when we notice the other getting too hot\/heavy.  \n  \nI've never been one to make out this quickly let alone have sex so soon, but fireworks are flying. In my gut, I feel like he could be a long term keeper and he has already expressed the same. He's ready to show me off to his family. So I don't want to do anything too quickly and possibly ruin our relationship's chances at going the distance.   \n  \nBasically, an opportunity is coming up this weekend. Its technically past the one week mark of us seeing each other face- to-face rather than just phone\/text\/email. We are connecting on every level and conversation flows freely.

{"prompt":"For the past few week my girlfriend has been wanting to go to a haunted house. She has asked my multiple times and I had curved the question by jokingly saying \"Yeah, only if someone holds my hand.\" And I even said that I'm not really into scary things.\n\nThe truth is that I have trouble coping with large amounts of anxiety and I barely even watch scary movies because of it.\n\nSo about a week ago I said I would go to a haunted house, at my girlfriend's request. Today, the day we were supposed to go, I told her I was nervous and I didn't know if I wanted to go. I told her I wouldn't enjoy the experience because of my anxiety, but I would still go if she wanted to. \n\nMy girlfriend seemed to take me confiding in her more as me letting her down than anything else. She started talking about how I should have said no to begin with, and why did I wait until the last minute to say I would be uncomfortable. \n\nI apologized and said if you really want to go, I will still go, but it just might not be enjoyable for me. She just shut down after this and is continuing to focus on me letting her down. \n\nI then suggested that we should still go out and do something, even if she wants to stay in because I wouldn't be comfortable at the haunted house. She initially rejected my suggestion, but eventually said, \"You plan what we'll do then. I just wanted to do something that we couldn't do any other time of the year. Where could we even go out to dinner that we haven't already been.\" (This is not verbatim, but just the gist of what she said)\n\nI understand I could have communicated more directly when she first brought up the haunted houses a few weeks ago. I take responsibility for that.  \n\nMy question is: What do I do now that my girlfriend is so disappointed that it almost seems like she's depressed? How do I make this into a good night, or is that not possible anymore?\n\nAny additional feedback unrelated to my primary questions is appreciated as well.

To make things worse one friend keeps obsessing over her in my presence and it hits at my underlying loneliness since I never had a true relationship. I feel like I need another group of friends to chill with but I don't know how to go about dealing with the consequences of such a move.","chosen":"Friend leaves the friendzone. Some go for her, I go for her too. I'm lonely and need another friend group.","rejected":"I'm a guy who's afraid of falling for a girl in group who's now twice as attractive and so I can't chill with her. What to do?"}

I was then serenaded by the lovely sounds of her screaming, \"Oh my f***** god!\" I half-jogged upstairs and saw her standing in the bathroom looking down into the tub. She told me, verbatim, \"Shadowheart321, I know guys have needs, but can you **PLEASE** keep it out of the shower and keep it in your room?\"\n\nI realized when I looked into the tub that we had just gotten a new drain catch and all of my nasty phlegm was stuck in it. I quickly caught on and started telling her that it wasn't what she thought and I was just really sick and I just had to blow my nose and it's not that, etc. She was listening to none of it and was still just staring into the tub with an appalled face on. As I bantered, my other roommate walked into the room to see what the fuss was about, and before I could even try to explain what happened, he looked into the tub and started absolutely hollering. In a last ditch effort to prove to them that it wasn't *that*, I leaned over, stuck my hand into the drain catch and scooped up some of my nasal droppings and told them to take a deep wiff of it. Then both turned out of the bathroom looking queasy as I stood there with a handful of mucus sitting in my palm. I will forever be known as the guy who picked up his own load from the bottom of the shower and told them to smell.","chosen":"blew my nose in the shower, roommate and other roommate saw, tried to prove that it wasn't that, ended up with a bunch of nasty mucus in my hand, will forever be known as the guy who picked up his own load","rejected":"blew my nose in the shower, roommate heard, went into tub to find out it wasn't that, ended up scooping up my nasal droppings and spewing them all over my hands and floor."}

{"prompt":"Hey relationship redditors,\n\nI have a quick and intriguing question about relationships in college. What would you do in this situation? It is kind of awkward once I really think about it. Here's my short story. \n\nI'm 20 years old in college. In our college's honor program enjoying life and utilizing my brain to the highest capacity. I've met some really cool people over the couple years at my college. I wasn't too interested in girl's at first, however I am comfortable around them now. I wasn't before. I still am a little reserved, but that's all worked out now. I've changed up my lifestyle and negative habits and I'm in college to be a doctor! Only black man in my honors philosophy course and everyone else is white. Representing the black community! We need to represented in these sophisticated classes! XD\n\nAnyway, I knew this really nice girl from last semester. We met in the hall after a random instance. I don't know how we got to know each other, but anyway I really like talking to her. However, she told me that she's not too interested in doing anything out. Like going out. She's pretty comfy where she's at now and doesn't want to date. She told me that she liked me, but doesn't want to do that type of thing. It's pretty understandable.\n\nShe has a sister and I can sense that she really likes me! 0.o. It is a weird feeling, but all I do is politely bob my head to say hi and she really lights up when she sees me. And I ended up eating lunch with her. It was a really good meal and we have similar interests. She's a vegetarian and was on a cleanse and ate some really good looking salad! That alone was very admirable! Because I thought, \"wow that's exactly what I'd do!\" She kind of hinted and have me good vibes, but I could be wrong.","chosen":"Met really nice girl in hall.

{"prompt":"hi, reddit,\n\nI've come here to ask a few questions... And thank you all in advance for reading.\n\nI'm a police officer, my boyfriend is a bartender. We've been together for about 3 years. We've had a lot of ups and some downs. \nWhen we first met (before I was in LE) we would frequently hang out at bars together. Now, I work night shift and my patrol area is a large group of bars where I basically deal with drunks constantly throughout the night.\n\nMy boyfriend is a bartender in that bar area. Lately he's been going out and drinking (mostly beer I believe) until about 1am give or take in this bar district. He does this while I'm at work over night. He does this about 3-4 times a week. \n\nSometimes it hurts my feelings because I work so hard in that area to do my job... Getting cussed, thrown up on, working car accidents, DWIs ect. It hurts me to think about my boyfriend hanging out and drinking at these bars while I'm working my butt off overnight.  If it was occasionally, I wouldn't mind. But it's several nights a week. \n\nI know my job is dangerous and I picked my career so I should deal with it. I don't feel like I deserve any special treatment but it also hurts when he decides to stay out and drink instead of coming by the house to say goodbye or anything at all before I go to work. I'm not saying be there every single day but... Maybe shoot me a text or something atleast.  \n\nI feel bad for letting it bother me, and I don't want to feel this way. I also don't know who he's with or when he'll eventually go home so that adds to it.. He knows my feelings on the situation but I feel that he does what he wants sometimes and will just brush it off or just apologize for it later.\n\nI don't want to nag him, he's a grown ass man... But at the same time, I'm not sure if I could have a potential future with him considering my career. \n\nIs this normal for guys to do and am I just over reacting?","chosen":"my boyfriend spends a lot of time drinking around bars when I work and it bothers me. Wondering what I should do\/ say to him to try and calm down\/ get things back on track?","rejected":"Boyfriend of 3 years is a bartender and often hangs out and drinks despite me working hard.

We never really hang out or anything, but we always greeted each other and talked for a bit if we saw each other anywhere.\n\nI got the number, even though it seemed like she wasn't too interested when she gave me it. She made an excuse when i called her to meet up, so i just figured she's not interested, but i can't just forget her, i'm in deep, even hearing her voice when i called her is like a drug to me. \n\nShe studies in a city about an hour away at the moment, which i will be going to with my friend. It's not because of her, we're going just to go out and party there, it's the capital here.\n\nWhich brings me up to my question.\nDo you guys\/girls think there is still a chance? Should i call her one last time when i'll be there and ask if there is a chance if she makes an excuse again or what?

She made an excuse when i called her to meet up, so i just figured she's not interested, but i can't just forget her, i'm in deep, even hearing her voice when i called her is like a drug to me. \n\nShe studies in a city about an hour away at the moment, which i will be going to with my friend. It's not because of her, we're going just to go out and party there, it's the capital here.\n\nWhich brings me up to my question.\nDo you guys\/girls think there is still a chance?

{"prompt":"Hey everyone. My roommate and I are coming to the end of 2 years of living together. Long story short, I will not continue to live with him beyond 2 years.\n\nWe used to work together and I thought he had his act together. Little did I know it was all a front. He hardly leaves the apartment besides to go to work, never buys household goods, barely cleans up after himself, and definitely doesn't do his fair share of things around the apt.\n\nHe's generally a nice guy but he's completely oblivious and can be really inconsiderate. For example we used to smoke (weed) together from time to time. I am for the most part cool with it. Then it started turning into 12 hour smoke sessions where he would sit in his room all day smoking. I eventually asked him to stop smoking inside, but slowly he started to again. Finally one night, I had had enough and I called him out and he's taken to smoking outside.\n\nSo here's what happened. At the beginning of the month he told me a friend of his needed a place to stay for a few days. I obliged under the agreement that she wouldn't be in the apt all day (I'm working from home and interviewing, speaking on the phone with privileged information, financials, etc.)\n\nHere we are almost two weeks later. She's been here almost every day. The one day she wasn't here, he had his FWB staying the night.\n\nI'm incredibly annoyed at this point. I texted him yesterday (as I knew I wouldn't be home when he was.) Yet he never replied. I texted him again this AM and still crickets.\n\nMy friends say I'm more upset than I should be, but I think my anger is justified. It makes more work for me (constantly emptying the dishwasher, trash I only take out, lack of any kind of alone time in MY own apartment.) I'm not sure what to do at this point. I know I have to confront him but I feel like such a nag with these situations he puts me in. Any type of advice for confronting this would be really appreciated.","chosen":"Roommate's random guest stays at my apt almost everyday despite clearly being an irresponsible bum.

{"prompt":"My 3 year old GSD x Husky rescue stayed with some relatives for a few days while my boyfriend and I moved house, and the relatives found an old choke chain to walk him with, instead of his Mekuti harness.

He hasn't pulled when on the choke chain at all, even when it was first put on apparently, so we think that is what he was trained on (and damage from that process is probably why his barks and whines sound a bit odd).

If he ever started pulling on the lead so that the choker was tight, I would stop using it straight away. The last thing I want is my dog being hurt.

I'm just worried about potential issues with the state of the house come that time and how much my deposit will be included in damages they do in the coming months.\nGetting the new guy (that's replacing me) to just give me the share of the deposit also doesn't exactly work, since we do not know how much of the deposit would be used in the current state of the house. When I move out it will be 2 years at that house.\n\nWhat should I do in this case?","chosen":"Moving out, roommates staying, I don't get my deposit back until everyone else moves out? What should I do in this case to avoid potential damages from the state of the house?","rejected":"Moving out, roommates staying, they are using the deposit from the current lease and I don't get my deposit back until everyone else moves out. What should I do?"}
{"prompt":"So basically there's this girl in my class whom I'm attracted to and I think that there is a chance that we could end up being a couple, but there seems to be a few things that can prevent that from happening. \n\n1.

{"prompt":"Background:\nI'm 21(F) and he's 25. He moved in with his old college room mates about a year ago, and they're a terrible influence on him. Before he moved in there, he used to go to the gym regularly, eat well, and go to church. Since he's moved in with them, he's gained about 30 lbs. To be fair, I've gained weight as well since we started dating, but it's mostly because I started at a University with a meal plan, and later on I could only afford cheap, less-healthy food. I've been trying to work with him constantly for both of us to go to the gym more, eat better, and go to church together.  He ends up going out to eat way more than he should (his friends all have good paying jobs and don't really care about their health, while he's still looking for a job in his field of study), and is just generally negatively affected by the environment.

After he sets everything up he starts raging because the DLC passport for multiplayer is region locked meaning he couldn't play online. Being a gamer myself i seem sorry because I know that's why he plays games but he then try's to exchange it with a game store in another CITY! Since I was getting tired I ask if I can stay at his place and he says yes. Come morning I fix the problem by logging in my account and downloading it on his ps3 he thanks me and plays it like there wasn't 1 hour of rage last night.","chosen":"friend got angry cause region locked DLC passport for online play was region locked, tried to exchange it and played it like there was no rage last night. what's the most ungrateful thing you ever see a person do ?","rejected":"friend get's a game he wants from me then goes apeshit when he can't play online due to region locking. thanks reddit for the awesome supportive comments! :)"}

But in the last couple of months I've come to a startling realization. \n\nGay men annoy me. \n\nIt's not hate, or discomfort. I'm against hate in any form, assuming a particular person hasn't done something to rouse my ire. I support gay marriage and consider myself an LGBT ally. I've had a lot of close gay friends - mostly through theatre - and I've kissed guys full on the lips in front of packed auditoriums 5 days a week without trepidation.

I like hanging out with women, and when you take the whole \"are we gonna bang?\" tension out of the picture it's relaxing as can be.\n\nIt's not the being gay that annoys me. It's the acting gay - acting *really* gay. Everyone knows what I'm talking about. It just seems disingenuous when someone's being as flamboyant as possible. I can understand it when someone's just coming out and feels the need to express their sexual identity, or in a pride parade - go wild, I say. \n\nBut when I see adult men acting like total queens, I just want to tell them to grow the hell up.

Blegh.\n\n**BUT.** I could totally be in the wrong here. I might just be an asshole. This bothers me.

{"prompt":"Hello, I need some help. My dog has a licking problem, one where she will continue to lick one particular spot. I've had her for a year and during this time, there is always one spot at a time she keeps licking, 4 in total so far, with one being here for months now on her front leg, fur is gone and it was infected before. She keeps licking until it bleeds, and when I find out I'll put ointment on it. I've been to the vet before because she seems to have developed an allergy to something randomly (started getting scaly skin and dandruff), but it hasn't been determined what it is yet (not food) and the licking issue, while brought up, wasn't really directly addressed. This is getting very stressful though, as my dad is also pressuring me to give her up to tend to my own emotional needs I'm trying to attend. I've tried to pinpoint if it may be something such as bordem, but I'm attending college, though not in school right now as it's summer and I currently don't have a job so I literally have spent months just her and me. I know it's not her \"fault\" but she keeps breaking my trust. If she's alone for literally 5 minutes, whether it's me showering or her going to her kennel after a walk and I'm in the living room she goes at it and then is afraid to see me because she knows how disappointed I get. I can tell whenever she does it everytime. I've tried wrapping it in every which way but she has torn everything off right after I leave her alone, and while I don't have an official E-collar, she has scratched off the homemade one as well silently, when she was sitting behind me.

She's also rather princessy, and would likely complain about a lot of the hikes\/nature things I have planned. I wanted to pack my dog up and go, and enjoy some peace and quiet for once in my life. I know that 3-months in each other's faces would probably cause a fight, and that's the last thing I want to deal with on this trip. Is there a way I can tell her this is something I want to do alone, or should I just bring her and hope for the best?

{"prompt":"Hi Ladies and Gents, \n\nSo.. a few months ago, I had a devastating break-up. I mean completely awful, worst break-up I've ever gone through, total nightmare situation. We dated for a year and a half. I did not have any closure, and his behavior was (and continues to be) downright spiteful and abusive. We lived together, so I ended up moving back with my mom for a bit. I am currently going through a kind of transitory period, and have just gotten a new part-time job. \n\nOn the first day of my new job, one of the new supervisors came in, and my stomach dropped. This man is an exact copy of my Ex. Hair, glasses, clothes.. everything. I actually had trouble training with him because I felt weirdly sick and turned on in equal measure. \n\nTomorrow is day 2. I am not sure how to handle this situation. I feel like I am already acting weird around this person, who is more or less a total stranger to me. I know I am projecting my feelings about my ex onto coworker, but I'm not sure how to control this situation. One minute, I want to punch him in the face. The next minute, I want him to fuck me on his desk.","chosen":"new coworker is spitting-image of my nightmare ex. dont know how to handle situation around coworker, need advice on how to act around him without projecting my ex onto coworker.","rejected":"Got new job. new coworker spitting image of horrible ex i had 1.5 yrs ago.. need advice on how to control the situation and not freak out\/react badly."}
